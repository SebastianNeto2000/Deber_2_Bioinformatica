AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a recently 
      discovered coronavirus termed 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2' 
      (SARS-CoV-2). Several scholars have tested antiviral drugs and compounds to overcome 
      COVID-19. 'Kefir' is a fermented milk drink similar to a thin yogurt that is made 
      from kefir grains. Kefir and its probiotic contents can modulate the immune system 
      to suppress infections from viruses (e.g., Zika, hepatitis C, influenza, 
      rotaviruses). The antiviral mechanisms of kefir involve enhancement of macrophage 
      production, increasing phagocytosis, boosting production of cluster of 
      differentiation-positive (CD4(+)), CD8(+), immunoglobulin (Ig)G(+) and IgA(+) B 
      cells, T cells, neutrophils, as well as cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL)-2, IL-12, 
      interferon gamma-γ). Kefir can act as an anti-inflammatory agent by reducing 
      expression of IL-6, IL-1, TNF-α, and interferon-γ. Hence, kefir might be a 
      significant inhibitor of the 'cytokine storm' that contributes to COVID-19. Here, we 
      review several studies with a particular emphasis on the effect of kefir consumption 
      and their microbial composition against viral infection, as well as discussing the 
      further development of kefir as a protective supplementary dietary against 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection via modulating the immune response.

TI  - Kefir: a powerful probiotics with anticancer properties.
PG  - 183
LID - 10.1007/s12032-017-1044-9 [doi]
AB  - Probiotics and fermented milk products have attracted the attention of scientists 
      from various fields, such as health care, industry and pharmacy. In recent years, 
      reports have shown that dietary probiotics such as kefir have a great potential for 
      cancer prevention and treatment. Kefir is fermented milk with Caucasian and Tibet 
      origin, made from the incubation of kefir grains with raw milk or water. Kefir 
      grains are a mixture of yeast and bacteria, living in a symbiotic association. 
      Antibacterial, antifungal, anti-allergic and anti-inflammatory effects are some of 
      the health beneficial properties of kefir grains. Furthermore, it is suggested that 
      some of the bioactive compounds of kefir such as polysaccharides and peptides have 
      great potential for inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in tumor 
      cells. Many studies revealed that kefir acts on different cancers such as colorectal 
      cancer, malignant T lymphocytes, breast cancer and lung carcinoma. In this review, 
      we have focused on anticancer properties of kefir.

TI  - Milk kefir: nutritional, microbiological and health benefits.
PG  - 82-96
LID - 10.1017/S0954422416000275 [doi]
AB  - Kefir is fermented milk produced from grains that comprise a specific and complex 
      mixture of bacteria and yeasts that live in a symbiotic association. The nutritional 
      composition of kefir varies according to the milk composition, the microbiological 
      composition of the grains used, the time/temperature of fermentation and storage 
      conditions. Kefir originates from the Caucasus and Tibet. Recently, kefir has raised 
      interest in the scientific community due to its numerous beneficial effects on 
      health. Currently, several scientific studies have supported the health benefits of 
      kefir, as reported historically as a probiotic drink with great potential in health 
      promotion, as well as being a safe and inexpensive food, easily produced at home. 
      Regular consumption of kefir has been associated with improved digestion and 
      tolerance to lactose, antibacterial effect, hypocholesterolaemic effect, control of 
      plasma glucose, anti-hypertensive effect, anti-inflammatory effect, antioxidant 
      activity, anti-carcinogenic activity, anti-allergenic activity and healing effects. 
      A large proportion of the studies that support these findings were conducted in 
      vitro or in animal models. However, there is a need for systematic clinical trials 
      to better understand the effects of regular use of kefir as part of a diet, and for 
      their effect on preventing diseases. Thus, the present review focuses on the 
      nutritional and microbiological composition of kefir and presents relevant findings 
      associated with the beneficial effects of kefir on human and animal health.

TI  - Analysis of Health Benefits Conferred by Lactobacillus Species from Kefir.
LID - 10.3390/nu11061252 [doi]
LID - 1252
AB  - Lactobacilli are among the most common microorganisms found in kefir; a traditional 
      fermented milk beverage produced locally in many locations around the world. Kefir 
      has been associated with a wide range of purported health benefits; such as 
      antimicrobial activity; cholesterol metabolism; immunomodulation; anti-oxidative 
      effects; anti-diabetic effects; anti-allergenic effects; and tumor suppression. This 
      review critically examines and assesses these claimed benefits and mechanisms with 
      regard to particular Lactobacillus species and/or strains that have been derived 
      from kefir; as well as detailing further potential avenues for experimentation.

TI  - The Many Faces of Kefir Fermented Dairy Products: Quality Characteristics, Flavour 
      Chemistry, Nutritional Value, Health Benefits, and Safety.
LID - 10.3390/nu12020346 [doi]
LID - 346
AB  - Kefir is a dairy product that can be prepared from different milk types, such as 
      goat, buffalo, sheep, camel, or cow via microbial fermentation (inoculating milk 
      with kefir grains). As such, kefir contains various bacteria and yeasts which 
      influence its chemical and sensory characteristics. A mixture of two kinds of milk 
      promotes kefir sensory and rheological properties aside from improving its 
      nutritional value. Additives such as inulin can also enrich kefir's health qualities 
      and organoleptic characters. Several metabolic products are generated during kefir 
      production and account for its distinct flavour and aroma: Lactic acid, ethanol, 
      carbon dioxide, and aroma compounds such as acetoin and acetaldehyde. During the 
      storage process, microbiological, physicochemical, and sensory characteristics of 
      kefir can further undergo changes, some of which improve its shelf life. Kefir 
      exhibits many health benefits owing to its antimicrobial, anticancer, 
      gastrointestinal tract effects, gut microbiota modulation and anti-diabetic effects. 
      The current review presents the state of the art relating to the role of probiotics, 
      prebiotics, additives, and different manufacturing practices in the context of 
      kefir's physicochemical, sensory, and chemical properties. A review of kefir's many 
      nutritional and health benefits, underlying chemistry and limitations for usage is 
      presented.

TI  - Kefir and Cancer: A Systematic Review of Literatures.
PG  - 852-7
AB  - Some studies have suggested chemopreventive effects of kefir, a fermented milk 
      product, on carcinogenesis. The aim of this review study was to evaluate the 
      scientific evidence for effects of kefir on cancer prevention and treatment. We 
      systematically searched for all relevant studies published before June 2015, using 
      PubMed, Google scholar, Cochrane and Science Direct, SID, MedLib and Srlst 
      databases. Relevant studies were reviewed based on systematic review (PRISMA) 
      guidelines. From a total of 2208 papers obtained at the initial database search, 11 
      publications including 7 in vitro and 4 experimental studies were eligible. In vitro 
      studies on breast, colon, skin and gastric cancers and leukemia cell lines and 
      experimental studies on different sarcomas consistently showed beneficial effects of 
      kefir on cancer prevention and treatment. The results of this systematic review 
      suggest that kefir may be associated with cancer prevention and it also has 
      beneficial effects in cancer treatment. This protection may be associated with kefir 
      bioactive components including peptides, polysaccharides and sphingolipids.

AB  - Kefir is a fermented beverage with renowned probiotics that coexist in symbiotic 
      association with other microorganisms in kefir grains. This beverage consumption is 
      associated with a wide array of nutraceutical benefits, including anti-inflammatory, 
      anti-oxidative, anti-cancer, anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, anti-hypertensive, and 
      anti-hypercholesterolemic effects. Moreover, kefir can be adapted into different 
      substrates which allow the production of new functional beverages to provide product 
      diversification. Being safe and inexpensive, there is an immense global interest in 
      kefir's nutritional potential. Due to their promising benefits, kefir and kefir-like 
      products have a great prospect for commercialization. This manuscript reviews the 
      therapeutic aspects of kefir to date, and potential applications of kefir products 
      in the health and food industries, along with the limitations. The literature 
      reviewed here demonstrates that there is a growing demand for kefir as a functional 
      food owing to a number of health-promoting properties.

AB  - Kefir is a complex fermented dairy product created through the symbiotic 
      fermentation of milk by lactic acid bacteria and yeasts contained within an 
      exopolysaccharide and protein complex called a kefir grain. As with other fermented 
      dairy products, kefir has been associated with a range of health benefits such as 
      cholesterol metabolism and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, 
      antimicrobial activity, tumor suppression, increased speed of wound healing, and 
      modulation of the immune system including the alleviation of allergy and asthma. 
      These reports have led to increased interest in kefir as a focus of research and as 
      a potential probiotic-containing product. Here, we review those studies with a 
      particular emphasis on the microbial composition and the health benefits of the 
      product, as well as discussing the further development of kefir as an important 
      probiotic product.

TI  - Kefir micro-organisms: their role in grain assembly and health properties of 
      fermented milk.
PG  - 686-700
LID - 10.1111/jam.14107 [doi]
AB  - Kefir is a homemade viscous and slightly effervescent beverage obtained by milk 
      fermentation with kefir grains, which are built up by a complex community of lactic 
      acid and acetic acid bacteria and yeasts confined in a matrix of proteins and 
      polysaccharides. The present review summarizes the role of kefir micro-organisms in 
      grain assembly and in the beneficial properties attributed to kefir. The use of both 
      culture-dependent and independent methods has made possible to determine the 
      micro-organisms that constitute this ecosystem. Kefir consumption has been 
      associated with a wide range of functional and probiotic properties that could be 
      attributed to the micro-organisms present in kefir and/or to the metabolites 
      synthetized by them during milk fermentation. In this context, the role of 
      micro-organisms in kefir health promoting properties is discussed with particular 
      attention to the contribution of yeast as well as bioactive metabolites such as 
      lactic and acetic acid, exopolysaccharides and bioactive peptides. Even though many 
      advances on the knowledge of this ancient fermented milk have been made, further 
      studies are necessary to elucidate the complex nature of the kefir ecosystem.

TI  - Effect of administering kefir on the changes in fecal microbiota and symptoms of 
      inflammatory bowel disease: A randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 242-253
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2018.18227 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Kefir is a kind of fermented probiotic dairy product. The objective 
      of the present study was to investigate the effects of kefir consumption on the 
      fecal microflora and symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Kefir was serially diluted and inoculated into de Man, 
      Rogosa, and Sharpe agar and incubated at 37°C for 48 to 72 h under anaerobic 
      conditions. This was a single-center, prospective, open-label randomized controlled 
      trial. Forty-five patients with IBD were classified into two groups: 25 for 
      treatment and 20 for control. A 400 mL/day kefir was administered to the patients 
      for 4 weeks day and night. Their stool Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus kefiri, content 
      was quantitated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction before and after 
      consumption. Abdominal pain, bloating, stool frequency, stool consistency, and 
      feeling good scores were recorded in diaries daily by the patients. RESULTS: A 5×107 
      CFU/mL count of lactic acid bacteria colony forming units was found in a kefir 
      sample as the total average count. Lactobacillus bacterial load of feces of all 
      subjects in the treatment group was between 104 and 109 CFU/g, and the first and 
      last measurements were statistically significant (p=0.001 in ulcerative colitis and 
      p=0.005 in Crohn's disease (CD)). The L. kefiri bacterial load in the stool of 17 
      subjects was measured as between 104 and 106 CFU/g. For patients with CD, there was 
      a significant decrease in erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, 
      whereas hemoglobin increased, and for the last 2 weeks, bloating scores were 
      significantly reduced (p=0.012), and feeling good scores increased (p=0.032). 
      CONCLUSION: According to our data, kefir consumption may modulate gut microbiota, 
      and regular consumption of kefir may improve the patient's quality of life in the 
      short term.

AB  - Kefir is a fermented milk beverage produced by the action of bacteria and yeasts 
      that exist in symbiotic association in kefir grains. The artisanal production of the 
      kefir is based on the tradition of the peoples of Caucasus, which has spread to 
      other parts of the world, from the late 19(th) century, and nowadays integrates its 
      nutritional and therapeutic indications to the everyday food choices of several 
      populations. The large number of microorganisms present in kefir and their microbial 
      interactions, the possible bioactive compounds resulting of microbial metabolism, 
      and the benefits associated with the use this beverage confers kefir the status of a 
      natural probiotic, designated as the 21(th) century yoghurt. Several studies have 
      shown that kefir and its constituents have antimicrobial, antitumor, 
      anticarcinogenic and immunomodulatory activity and also improve lactose digestion, 
      among others. This review includes data on the technological aspects, the main 
      beneficial effects on human health of kefir and its microbiological composition. 
      Generally, kefir grains contain a relatively stable and specific microbiota enclosed 
      in a matrix of polysaccharides and proteins. Microbial interactions in kefir are 
      complex due to the composition of kefir grains, which seems to differ among 
      different studies, although some predominant Lactobacillus species are always 
      present. Besides, the specific populations of individual grains seem to contribute 
      to the particular sensory characteristics present in fermented beverages. This 
      review also includes new electron microscopy data on the distribution of 
      microorganisms within different Brazilian kefir grains, which showed a relative 
      change in its distribution according to grain origin.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes recent animal and human trials examining 
      the potential for kefir to improve obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and 
      non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Evidence for pathways affected and 
      suggestions of possible mechanisms of action are also considered. RECENT FINDINGS: 
      Human trials examining the ability of kefir to recapitulate metabolic health 
      benefits previously observed in rodent models have found mixed results. Kefir has 
      long been associated with improvements in health including obesity, diabetes, NAFLD, 
      and dyslipidemia in preventative animal trials. While recent evidence from human 
      trials supports a positive role of kefir in modulating diabetes-related markers, the 
      impact of kefir consumption on markers of dyslipidemia, NAFLD, and body composition 
      has been for the most part contradictory to animal findings. Variability in 
      organisms for kefir fermentation poses a significant challenge in making meaningful 
      comparisons. Recommendations for future well-controlled animal and human research 
      are provided.

AB  - Kefir is a natural complex fermented milk product containing more than 50 species of 
      probiotic bacteria and yeast, and has been demonstrated to have multiple properties 
      conferring health benefits, including antiobesity, anti-hepatic steatosis, 
      antioxidative, antiallergenic, antitumor, anti-inflammatory, cholesterol-lowering, 
      constipation-alleviating, and antimicrobial properties. To better understand the 
      underlying mechanisms of these benefits, we here review research on the effect of 
      kefir (and kefir microorganisms) consumption to modulate the host gut microbiota. 
      Owing to its excellent gastrointestinal resistance and colonization ability and wide 
      ranges of microbial interaction, kefir has shown significant and wide-spectrum 
      modulatory effects on the host gut microbiota. In particular, as a bacteria- and 
      yeast-containing food, kefir can modulate both the gut microbiota and mycobiota. 
      Since the association of this modulation with health benefit has only been addressed 
      in a small number of recent studies thus far, further studies are needed to 
      determine the precise mechanisms of the beneficial effects of kefir in relation to 
      the modulation of the gut microbiota and mycobiota. Gaining this insight will surely 
      help to take full advantage of this unique probiotic food.

TI  - Isolation and Characterization of Lactobacillus spp. from Kefir Samples in Malaysia.
LID - 10.3390/molecules24142606 [doi]

AB  - Kefir is a homemade, natural fermented product comprised of a probiotic bacteria and 
      yeast complex. Kefir consumption has been associated with many advantageous 
      properties to general health, including as an antioxidative, anti-obesity, 
      anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-tumor moiety. This beverage is commonly 
      found and consumed by people in the United States of America, China, France, Brazil, 
      and Japan. Recently, the consumption of kefir has been popularized in other 
      countries including Malaysia. The microflora in kefir from different countries 
      differs due to variations in culture conditions and the starter media. Thus, this 
      study was aimed at isolating and characterizing the lactic acid bacteria that are 
      predominant in Malaysian kefir grains via macroscopic examination and 16S ribosomal 
      RNA gene sequencing. The results revealed that the Malaysian kefir grains are 
      dominated by three different strains of Lactobacillus strains, which are 
      Lactobacillus harbinensis, Lactobacillusparacasei, and Lactobacillus plantarum. The 
      probiotic properties of these strains, such as acid and bile salt tolerances, 
      adherence ability to the intestinal mucosa, antibiotic resistance, and hemolytic 
      test, were subsequently conducted and extensively studied. The isolated 
      Lactobacillus spp. from kefir H maintained its survival rate within 3 h of 
      incubation at pH 3 and pH 4 at 98.0 ± 3.3% and 96.1 ± 1.7% of bacteria growth and 
      exhibited the highest survival at bile salt condition at 0.3% and 0.5%. The same 
      isolate also showed high adherence ability to intestinal cells at 96.3 ± 0.01%, has 
      antibiotic resistance towards ampicillin, penicillin, and tetracycline, and showed 
      no hemolytic activity. In addition, the results of antioxidant activity tests 
      demonstrated that isolated Lactobacillus spp. from kefir G possessed high 
      antioxidant activities for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content 
      (TFC), ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazine 
      (DPPH) assay compared to other isolates. From these data, all Lactobacillus spp. 
      isolated from Malaysian kefir serve as promising candidates for probiotics foods and 
      beverage since they exhibit potential probiotic properties and antioxidant 
      activities.

TI  - Kefir and Intestinal Microbiota Modulation: Implications in Human Health.
PG  - 638740

AB  - In the last decades changes in the pattern of health and disease in Latin America 
      and in the world has been observed, with an increase in cases of chronic 
      non-communicable diseases. Changes in intestinal microbiota composition can 
      contribute to the development of these diseases and be useful in their management. 
      In this context, the consumption of fermented foods with probiotic properties, such 
      as kefir, stands out due to its gut microbiota-modulating capacity. There is an 
      increasing interest in the commercial use of kefir since it can be marketed as a 
      natural beverage containing health-promoting bacteria and has been gaining 
      international popularity in Latin America. Also the consumption of these drinks in 
      Latin America seems to be even more relevant, given the socioeconomic situation of 
      this population, which highlights the need for disease prevention at the expense of 
      its treatment. In this narrative review, we discuss how kefir may work against 
      obesity, diabetes mellitus, liver disease, cardiovascular disorders, immunity, and 
      neurological disorders. Peptides, bioactive compounds and strains occurring in 
      kefir, can modulate gut microbiota composition, low-grade inflammation and 
      intestinal permeability, which consequently may generate health benefits. Kefir can 
      also impact on the regulation of organism homeostasis, with a direct effect on the 
      gut-brain axis, being a possible strategy for the prevention of metabolic diseases. 
      Further studies are needed to standardize these bioactive compounds and better 
      elucidate the mechanisms linking kefir and intestinal microbiota modulation. 
      However, due to the benefits reported, low cost and ease of preparation, kefir seems 
      to be a promising approach to prevent and manage microbiota-related diseases in 
      Latin America and the rest of the world.

AB  - Water kefir is a sparkling, slightly acidic fermented beverage produced by 
      fermenting a solution of sucrose, to which dried fruits have been added, with water 
      kefir grains. These gelatinous grains are a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast 
      embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. Lactic acid bacteria, yeast and acetic acid 
      bacteria are the primary microbial members of the sugary kefir grain. Amongst other 
      contributions, species of lactic acid bacteria produce the exopolysaccharide matrix 
      from which the kefir grain is formed, while yeast assists the bacteria by a nitrogen 
      source that can be assimilated. Exactly which species predominate within the grain 
      microbiota, however, appears to be dependent on the geographical origin of the 
      grains and the fermentation substrate and conditions. These factors ultimately 
      affect the characteristics of the beverage produced in terms of aroma, flavour, and 
      acidity, for example, but can also be controlled and exploited in the production of 
      a beverage of desired characteristics. The production of water kefir has 
      traditionally occurred on a small scale and the use of defined starter cultures is 
      not commonly practiced. However, as water kefir increases in popularity as a 
      beverage - in part because of consumer lifestyle trends and in part due to water 
      kefir being viewed as a health drink with its purported health benefits - the need 
      for a thorough understanding of the biology and dynamics of water kefir, and for 
      defined and controlled production processes, will ultimately increase. The aim of 
      this review is to provide an update into the current knowledge of water kefir.

TI  - Effects of Regular Kefir Consumption on Gut Microbiota in Patients with Metabolic 
      Syndrome: A Parallel-Group, Randomized, Controlled Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu11092089 [doi]
LID - 2089
AB  - Several health-promoting effects of kefir have been suggested, however, there is 
      limited evidence for its potential effect on gut microbiota in metabolic syndrome 
      This study aimed to investigate the effects of regular kefir consumption on gut 
      microbiota composition, and their relation with the components of metabolic 
      syndrome. In a parallel-group, randomized, controlled clinical trial setting, 
      patients with metabolic syndrome were randomized to receive 180 mL/day kefir (n = 
      12) or unfermented milk (n = 10) for 12 weeks. Anthropometrical measurements, blood 
      samples, blood pressure measurements, and fecal samples were taken at the beginning 
      and end of the study. Fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and systolic and 
      diastolic blood pressure showed a significant decrease by the intervention of kefir 
      (p ≤ 0.05, for each). However, no significant difference was obtained between the 
      kefir and unfermented milk groups (p > 0.05 for each). Gut microbiota analysis 
      showed that regular kefir consumption resulted in a significant increase only in the 
      relative abundance of Actinobacteria (p = 0.023). No significant change in the 
      relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria or Verrucomicrobia by kefir 
      consumption was obtained. Furthermore, the changes in the relative abundance of 
      sub-phylum bacterial populations did not differ significantly between the groups (p 
      > 0.05, for each). Kefir supplementation had favorable effects on some of the 
      metabolic syndrome parameters, however, further investigation is needed to 
      understand its effect on gut microbiota composition.

TI  - Kefir Peptides Prevent Hyperlipidemia and Obesity in High-Fat-Diet-Induced Obese 
      Rats via Lipid Metabolism Modulation.
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201700505 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Obesity has reached epidemic proportions worldwide. Obesity is a complex 
      metabolic disorder that is linked to numerous serious health complications with high 
      morbidity. The present study evaluated the effects of kefir peptides on high fat 
      diet (HFD)-induced obesity in rats. METHODS AND RESULTS: Kefir peptides markedly 
      improved obesity, including body weight gain, inflammatory reactions and the 
      formation of adipose tissue fat deposits around the epididymis and kidney, and 
      adipocyte size. Treating high fat diet (HFD)-induced obese rats with kefir peptides 
      significantly reduced the fatty acid synthase protein and increased the p-acetyl-CoA 
      carboxylase protein to block lipogenesis in the livers. Kefir peptides also 
      increased fatty acid oxidation by increasing the protein expressions of 
      phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase, peroxisome proliferator-activated 
      receptor-α, and hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 in the livers. In addition, 
      administration of kefir peptides significantly decreased the inflammatory response 
      (TNF-α, IL-1β, and TGF-β) to modulate oxidative damage. CONCLUSION: These results 
      demonstrate that kefir peptides treatment improves obesity via inhibition of 
      lipogenesis, modulation of oxidative damage, and stimulation of lipid oxidation. 
      Therefore, kefir peptides may act as an anti-obesity agent to prevent body fat 
      accumulation and obesity-related metabolic diseases.

TI  - Fermented Foods: Definitions and Characteristics, Impact on the Gut Microbiota and 
      Effects on Gastrointestinal Health and Disease.
LID - 10.3390/nu11081806 [doi]
LID - 1806
AB  - Fermented foods are defined as foods or beverages produced through controlled 
      microbial growth, and the conversion of food components through enzymatic action. In 
      recent years, fermented foods have undergone a surge in popularity, mainly due to 
      their proposed health benefits. The aim of this review is to define and characterise 
      common fermented foods (kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, tempeh, natto, miso, kimchi, 
      sourdough bread), their mechanisms of action (including impact on the microbiota), 
      and the evidence for effects on gastrointestinal health and disease in humans. 
      Putative mechanisms for the impact of fermented foods on health include the 
      potential probiotic effect of their constituent microorganisms, the 
      fermentation-derived production of bioactive peptides, biogenic amines, and 
      conversion of phenolic compounds to biologically active compounds, as well as the 
      reduction of anti-nutrients. Fermented foods that have been tested in at least one 
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) for their gastrointestinal effects were kefir, 
      sauerkraut, natto, and sourdough bread. Despite extensive in vitro studies, there 
      are no RCTs investigating the impact of kombucha, miso, kimchi or tempeh in 
      gastrointestinal health. The most widely investigated fermented food is kefir, with 
      evidence from at least one RCT suggesting beneficial effects in both lactose 
      malabsorption and Helicobacter pylori eradication. In summary, there is very limited 
      clinical evidence for the effectiveness of most fermented foods in gastrointestinal 
      health and disease. Given the convincing in vitro findings, clinical high-quality 
      trials investigating the health benefits of fermented foods are warranted.

TI  - Bioactive Compounds from Kefir and Their Potential Benefits on Health: A Systematic 
      Review and Meta-Analysis.

AB  - Despite evidence of health benefits from kefir administration, a systematic review 
      with meta-analysis on bioactive compounds associated with these benefits is still 
      absent in the literature. Kefir is fermented milk resulting from the metabolism of a 
      complex microbiota in symbiosis. Recent researches have investigated the bioactive 
      compounds responsible for the preventive and therapeutic effects attributed to 
      kefir. However, differences in functional potential between industrial and artisanal 
      kefir are still controversial. Firstly, we identified differences in the microbial 
      composition among both types of kefir. Available evidence concerning the action of 
      different bioactive compounds from kefir on health, both from in vitro and in vivo 
      studies, was subsequently summarized to draw a primary conclusion of the dose and 
      the intervention time for effect, the producer microorganisms, the precursor in the 
      milk, and the action mechanism. Meta-analysis was performed to investigate the 
      statistically significant differences (P < 0.05) between intervention and control 
      and between both types of kefir for each health effect studied. In summary, the 
      bioactive compounds more commonly reported were exopolysaccharides, including 
      kefiran, bioactive peptides, and organic acids, especially lactic acid. Kefir 
      bioactive compounds presented antimicrobial, anticancer, and immune-modulatory 
      activities corroborated by the meta-analysis. However, clinical evidence is urgently 
      needed to strengthen the practical applicability of these bioactive compounds. The 
      mechanisms of their action were diverse, indicating that they can act by different 
      signaling pathways. Still, industrial and artisanal kefir may differ regarding 
      functional potential-OR of 8.56 (95% CI: 2.27-32.21, P ≤ .001)-according to the 
      observed health effect, which can be associated with differences in the microbial 
      composition between both types of kefir.

TI  - Water kefir: Factors affecting grain growth and health-promoting properties of the 
      fermented beverage.
LID - 10.1111/jam.15385 [doi]
AB  - Nowadays, the interest in the consumption of healthy foods has increased as well as 
      the homemade preparation of artisanal fermented product. Water kefir is an ancient 
      drink of uncertain origin, which has been passed down from generation to generation 
      and is currently consumed practically all over the world. Considering the recent and 
      extensive updates published on sugary kefir, this work aims to shed light on the 
      scientific works that have been published so far in relation to this complex 
      ecosystem. We focused our review evaluating the factors that affect the beverage 
      microbial and chemical composition that are responsible for the health attribute of 
      water kefir as well as the grain growth. The microbial ecosystem that constitutes 
      the grains and the fermented consumed beverage can vary according to the 
      fermentation conditions (time and temperature) and especially with the use of 
      different substrates (source of sugars, additives as fruits and molasses). In this 
      sense, the populations of microorganisms in the beverage as well as the metabolites 
      that they produce varies and in consequence their health properties. Otherwise, the 
      knowledge of the variables affecting grain growth are also discussed for its 
      relevance in maintenance of the starter biomass as well as the use of dextran for 
      technological application.

AB  - Kefir is a probiotic and fermented dairy product authentically produced from kefir 
      grains. Kefir grain, as a natural starter culture, contains numerous lactic acid 
      bacteria, acetic acid bacteria and yeasts within a polysaccharide structure. True 
      kefir is a miraculous food in terms of its favorable contributions to human health. 
      However, kefir starter cultures used in industrial kefir productions contain very 
      few lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. These starter cultures do not contain 
      characteristic kefir bacteria, such as Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, Lactobacillus 
      kefiri, and Lactobacillus parakefiri. The objective of this study was to compare the 
      intestinal microorganisms of BALB/c mice fed kefir produced from natural kefir 
      grains and kefir produced from starter culture. The mice in kefir groups were fed an 
      oral dose of 0.3 mL kefir/day for 15 days, and the control group did not receive 
      kefir. The feces were collected in metabolic cages, and the lactic acid bacteria, 
      yeasts-fungi, and Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium species were 
      determined. Additionally, PCR analysis based on yeast-fungus 23S rRNA was carried 
      out, and serial analysis was performed with an ABI 3100 Genetic Analyzer. Serum 
      total antioxidant status (TAS), serum total oxidant status (TOS) levels, 
      malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels were determined. The 
      mean lactic acid bacteria (LAB) contents of the feces samples obtained from the mice 
      fed kefir samples produced from kefir grains and starter culture were 9.08 log cfu/g 
      and 7.32 log cfu/g on the 15th day, respectively. Mold was found in both the starter 
      kefir group and in the control group (range, 1.91-2.02 log cfu/g). The mold was 
      identified as Trichoderma koningii, a potential human pathogen and carcinogen. It 
      was very impressive that mold was not observed in the feces samples of the mice fed 
      the kefir produced from kefir grains. The highest TAS value was determined in the 
      serum samples of mice fed kefir produced using kefir grains. MPO values in the small 
      intestines of mice fed kefir produced using starter culture were higher than those 
      in the CK group that was associated with possible inflammation. This study might 
      lead to new studies focused on the antifungal effects of kefir and on the importance 
      of using kefir grains in the production of kefir.

AB  - Kefir and its related products are renowned nutraceutical dairy products produced 
      through fermentation of yeasts and bacteria naturally present in grains of kefir. 
      The nutritional attributes of this self-carbonated beverage are due to presence of 
      vital nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, minerals, vitamins, and some 
      nutraceutical components. Antimicrobial activity, better gut health, 
      anticarcinogenic activity, control on serum glucose and cholesterol, control on 
      lactose intolerance and better immune system can be achieved through its regular 
      consumption. Moreover, on the one side kefir is good dietetic beverage, and of 
      particular interest of athletes, and on the other side the whole kefir is good for 
      feeding small babies and pre-schoolers for good tolerance against disease and quick 
      weight gain. Lots of works have been done on kefir from a health point of view. This 
      study summarizes all the data that have been compiled to date. The purpose of this 
      review is to gather information about microbiological, chemical, nutritional, and 
      therapeutic aspects of kefir and kefir-like products to provide justification for 
      its consumption. This review leads us to conclude that kefir begins a new dawn of 
      food for the mankind.

AB  - Kefir is a fermented beverage obtained as a result of lactic-alcoholic fermentation 
      of milk by using kefir grains or a starter culture. Kefir beverage has numerous 
      health benefits owing to its antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic 
      properties, while it could also regulate the gut microbiota. This beverage is 
      recommended as a nutritional approach to glycemic control. This systematic review 
      and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) aimed to evaluate the 
      effects of kefir beverage on the glycemic control. For this purpose, a literature 
      search was conducted via databases such as PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, and 
      Google Scholar for the articles published until July 2020 with no limitation. The 
      indicators of glycemic control were fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1c 
      (HbA1c), and insulin. In total, six RCTs on a total sample size of 323 subjects were 
      selected for the meta-analysis. Inverse-variance weighted mean difference (WMD) with 
      a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for the mean changes in HbA1c, FBG and 
      insulin compared to baseline. Considering the clinical heterogeneity caused by the 
      varied duration and dosage of kefir beverage treatment, a random effects model was 
      used to estimate the pooled WMD. Findings indicated a more significant reduction in 
      the FBS (WMD = -10.28; 95% CI: -16.53-4.02; P = 0.001) and insulin (WMD = -2.87; 95% 
      CI: -3.96-1.78; P < 0.00001) in the kefir treatment group. Furthermore, kefir 
      consumption could reduce HbA1c (HbA1c = -0.64 -1.36, 0.08), while this effect was 
      not considered significant (-0.64; 95% CI: -1.36-0.08; P = 0.08). The results of our 
      meta-analysis indicated that kefir beverage could reduce the FBS and insulin levels 
      without a significant effect on HbA1c. In general, our findings showed that kefir 
      beverages may have beneficial effects on glycemic control. However, more clinical 
      data and research into the mechanism of probiotics are required to clarify the 
      beneficial effects of probiotics on glycemic markers.

TI  - Kefir: a multifaceted fermented dairy product.
PG  - 123-35
LID - 10.1007/s12602-014-9168-0 [doi]
AB  - Kefir is a fermented dairy beverage produced by the actions of the microflora 
      encased in the "kefir grain" on the carbohydrates in the milk. Containing many 
      bacterial species already known for their probiotic properties, it has long been 
      popular in Eastern Europe for its purported health benefits, where it is routinely 
      administered to patients in hospitals and recommended for infants and the infirm. It 
      is beginning to gain a foothold in the USA as a healthy probiotic beverage, mostly 
      as an artisanal beverage, home fermented from shared grains, but also recently as a 
      commercial product commanding shelf space in retail establishments. This is similar 
      to the status of yogurts in the 1970s when yogurt was the new healthy product. 
      Scientific studies into these reported benefits are being conducted into these 
      health benefits, many with promising results, though not all of the studies have 
      been conclusive. Our review provides an overview of kefir's structure, microbial 
      profile, production, and probiotic properties. Our review also discusses alternative 
      uses of kefir, kefir grains, and kefiran (the soluble polysaccharide produced by the 
      organisms in kefir grains). Their utility in wound therapy, food additives, 
      leavening agents, and other non-beverage uses is being studied with promising 
      results.

TI  - Health-Promoting Properties of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei: A Focus on Kefir 
      Isolates and Exopolysaccharide-Producing Strains.
LID - 10.3390/foods10102239 [doi]
LID - 2239
AB  - Among artisanal fermented beverages, kefir (fermented milk drink) and water kefir 
      (fermented nondairy beverage) are of special interest because their grains can be 
      considered natural reservoirs of safe and potentially probiotic strains. In the last 
      years, several reports on Lacticaseibacillus paracasei (formerly Lactobacillus 
      paracasei) isolated from both artisanal fermented beverages were published focusing 
      on their health-promoting properties. Although this is not the predominant species 
      in kefir or water kefir, it may contribute to the health benefits associated to the 
      consumption of the fermented beverage. Since the classification of L. paracasei has 
      been a difficult task, the selection of an adequate method for identification, which 
      is essential to avoid mislabeling in products, publications, and some publicly 
      available DNA sequences, is discussed in the present work. The last findings in 
      health promoting properties of L. paracasei and the bioactive compounds are 
      described and compared to strains isolated from kefir, providing a special focus on 
      exopolysaccharides as effector molecules. The knowledge of the state of the art of 
      Lacticaseibacillus paracasei from kefir and water kefir can help to understand the 
      contribution of these microorganisms to the health benefits of artisanal beverages 
      as well as to discover new probiotic strains for applications in food industry.

AB  - The adverse health effects of benzene occupational and circumstance pollution 
      exposure are an increasing concern. It leads to damage to various human tissues 
      including bone marrow and ovarian tissues and many vital physiological processes. 
      Previous studies showed that kefir is a rich probiotic, having protective effect, 
      thanks to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory capacity. The 
      purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential efficacy of kefir to remediate 
      benzene toxicity in rat. Thirty-two female rats were randomly allocated and 
      administered orally with benzene and/or kefir during a period of 21 consecutive 
      days. At the end of the experiment, hematological and bone marrow cell changes were 
      estimated. The animals exposed to benzene exhibited anemia and a significant 
      decrease in the levels of white blood cell. Moreover, benzene led to the activation 
      of gene expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and 
      interleukin-6 (IL-6), a myelotoxicity in bone marrow cells. Our data showed that 
      kefir treatment alleviated benzene-associated weight loss and increased the number 
      of whole blood cells in peripheral blood and nucleated cells in the bone marrow. 
      Furthermore, these physiological results were observed with animals showing high 
      concentrations of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) determined from fecal samples, which 
      are considered an indicator of kefir-associated microorganisms. Our study suggests 
      that kefir is a potential nutritional supplement target to attenuate hematotoxicity 
      induced by benzene.

AB  - Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia among elderly 
      individuals worldwide, leading to a strong motor-cognitive decline and consequent 
      emotional distress and codependence. It is traditionally characterized by 
      amyloidogenic pathway formation of senile plaques, and recent studies indicate that 
      dysbiosis is also an important factor in AD's pathology. To overcome dysbiosis, 
      probiotics-as kefir-have shown to be a great therapeutic alternative for Alzheimer's 
      disease. In this present work, we explored kefir as a probiotic and a metabolite 
      source as a modulator of microbiome and amyloidogenic pathway, using a Drosophila 
      melanogaster model for AD (AD-like flies). Kefir microbiota composition was 
      determined through 16S rRNA sequencing, and the metabolome of each fraction (hexane, 
      dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol) was investigated. After treatment, 
      flies had their survival, climbing ability, and vacuolar lesions accessed. Kefir and 
      fraction treated flies improved their climbing ability survival rate and 
      neurodegeneration index. In conclusion, we show that kefir in natura, as well as its 
      fractions may be promising therapeutic source against AD, modulating amyloidogenic 
      related pathways.

AB  - In recent years, there has been a strong focus on beneficial foods with probiotic 
      microorganisms and functional organic substances. In this context, there is an 
      increasing interest in the commercial use of kefir, since it can be marketed as a 
      natural beverage that has health promoting bacteria. There are numerous commercially 
      available kefir based-products. Kefir may act as a matrix in the effective delivery 
      of probiotic microorganisms in different types of products. Also, the presence of 
      kefir's exopolysaccharides, known as kefiran, which has biological activity, 
      certainly adds value to products. Kefiran can also be used separately in other food 
      products and as a coating film for various food and pharmaceutical products. This 
      article aims to update the information about kefir and its microbiological 
      composition, biological activity of the kefir's microflora and the importance of 
      kefiran as a beneficial health substance.

TI  - A Big World in Small Grain: A Review of Natural Milk Kefir Starters.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8020192 [doi]
LID - 192
AB  - Milk kefir is a traditional fermented milk product whose consumption is becoming 
      increasingly popular. The natural starter for kefir production is kefir grain, which 
      consists of various bacterial and yeast species. At the industrial scale, however, 
      kefir grains are rarely used due to their slow growth, complex application, bad 
      reproducibility and high costs. Instead, mixtures of defined lactic acid bacteria 
      and sometimes yeasts are applied, which alter sensory and functional properties 
      compared to natural grain-based milk kefir. In order to be able to mimic natural 
      starter cultures for authentic kefir production, it is a prerequisite to gain deep 
      knowledge about the nature of kefir grains, its microbial composition, morphologic 
      structure, composition of strains on grains and the impact of environmental 
      parameters on kefir grain characteristics. In addition, it is very important to 
      deeply investigate the numerous multi-dimensional interactions among different 
      species, which play important roles on the formation and the functionality of 
      grains.

TI  - Potential beneficial effects of kefir and its postbiotic, kefiran, on child food 
      allergy.
PG  - 3770-3786
LID - 10.1039/d0fo03182h [doi]
AB  - Food allergies are known as the public health problem, affecting people of all age 
      groups, but more commonly in babies and children, with consequences for nutritional 
      status and quality of life. The increase in the consumption of healthy foods has 
      consequently led to an increased demand for functional foods with specific health 
      benefits. Thus, the pharmaceutical industry's interest in natural products has grown 
      every time and is therefore considered as an alternative to synthetic drugs. Kefir 
      has been outstanding for several years as promising in the manufacture of various 
      pharmaceutical products, due to its nutritional and therapeutic properties for the 
      treatment of many diseases. Currently, a wide variety of new functional foods are 
      appearing on the market, representing an important segment. Postbiotics, for 
      example, has stood out for being a product with action similar to probiotics, 
      without offering side effects. The kefiran is the postbiotic from kefir that 
      promotes potential beneficial effects on food allergy from the intestinal microbiome 
      to the immune system. In this context, it is necessary to know the main promoting 
      component of this functional effect. This review compiles the benefits that kefir, 
      and especially its postbiotic, kefiran, can bring to food allergy. In addition, it 
      serve as a subsidy for studies on the development of innovative nutraceutical 
      products, including the use of kefiran as an alternative therapy in food allergy.

AB  - Hypertension is associated with gut dysbiosis and dysregulation of the gut-brain 
      axis. Previous work has shown that probiotic treatments exert beneficial 
      cardiovascular effects in humans and animal models of hypertension. Coupled with the 
      evidence of elevated sympathetic outflow and chronic inflammation in hypertension, 
      we hypothesized that both peripherally and centrally mediated mechanisms underlie 
      the antihypertensive effects of kefir, a probiotic obtained from the fermentation of 
      milk by kefir grains. Eight-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) were 
      treated by oral gavage with either vehicle or kefir (0.3 ml/100 g/day; 9 weeks; 
      SHR-Kefir), and age-matched with vehicle-treated Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). Long-term 
      kefir treatment attenuated mean arterial pressure elevations in SHR-Kefir relative 
      to vehicle-treated SHRs. Peripherally, SHRs exhibited differences in the wall of the 
      jejunum (fewer Paneth cells per crypt of Lieberkϋhn and increased tunica muscularis 
      thickness) and higher serum lipopolysaccharide levels compared to WKY, alterations 
      which were reversed in SHR-Kefir. Centrally, kefir treatment reduced IL-6 and TNF-α 
      protein densities, and abolished the microglial activation observed in the 
      hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus and rostral ventrolateral medulla of SHRs. 
      Taken together, our findings indicate that the antihypertensive effects of long-term 
      kefir treatment occur, at least in part, through improved structural and functional 
      integrity of the intestinal wall and protection against neuroinflammation within 
      cardioregulatory nuclei.

AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the suitability of incorporating Fe(3)O(4) 
      (magnetite, M) NPs into water kefir (wKef) beverages. Magnetite NPs were synthesized 
      and coated with pectins (cM), and incorporated into wKef beverages obtained by 
      fermentation of a muscovado sugar solution with wKef grains. FeSO(4), usually 
      employed as fortifier, was used as a control. Four different beverages were 
      analyzed: wKef, wKef-cM, wKef-M, wKef-FeSO(4), indicating wKef beverages fortified 
      with cM, M or FeSO(4), respectively. Their stability was assessed by determining the 
      viability of total lactic acid bacteria and yeasts, and the composition of 
      saccharides along storage at 4 °C for up to 30 days. The toxicity of M and cM was 
      evaluated in an in vivo model of Artemia salina. The absorption of iron was 
      quantified by determining ferritin values on intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cells, and its 
      internalization mechanisms, by employing inhibitors of endocytic pathways and 
      quantifying ferritin. M and cM were non-toxic on Artemia salina up to 500 µg/mL, a 
      toxicity even lower than that of FeSO(4), which showed a LD50 of 304.08 µg/mL. After 
      30 days of storage, no significant decrease on yeasts viability was observed, and 
      bacteria viability was above 6 log CFU/mL for the four beverages. In turn, sucrose 
      decreased to undetectable values, concomitantly to an increase in the concentrations 
      of glucose and fructose. Both wKef-M and wKef-cM led to a significant increase in 
      the ferritin values (up to 2 folds) with regard to the basal state. The 
      internalization of M NPs occurred via clathrins and caveolin pathways, whereas that 
      of cM, by macropinocytosis. Safely incorporating M and cM NPs into wKef beverages 
      appear as an innovative strategy for providing bioavailable iron aiming to 
      ameliorate the nutritional status of populations at risk of iron deficiency (e.g., 
      vegans).

AB  - PURPOSE: This study investigated the effects of 12 wk of postexercise kefir 
      consumption in cancer survivors who have undergone chemotherapy and/or radiation 
      therapy. METHODS: All participants were enrolled in a structured exercise training 
      program and separated into kefir (KEF) or control (CON) treatment groups. KEF 
      consumed 8 oz. of kefir after exercise sessions (3 d·wk-1) for 12 wk. Outcome 
      measures included assessments for body size and composition, aerobic fitness and 
      muscular strength, medical history, and psychological state at pre- and 
      postintervention time points. Blood was collected and analyzed for C-reactive 
      protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations, 
      and LPS-stimulated whole blood IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor α production were 
      obtained using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays at both time points. Monocyte 
      numbers and phenotype were obtained using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Participants (N = 
      24; 9 males and 15 females) were an average of 61 ± 9.9 yr old. Kefir consumption 
      was associated with 6.3% (P = 0.034) improvements in lean body mass, as well as 
      51.4% (P = 0.046), 39.3% (P = 0.017), and 64.7% (P = 0.021) improvements in measures 
      of depression, fatigue, and gastric distress, respectively. KEF also experienced a 
      significant 35.4% (P = 0.01) reduction in circulating LPS along with an 18.0% 
      increase (P < 0.001) in classical monocytes % and a 22.3% decrease (P = 0.04) in 
      nonclassical monocytes %. There were no significant changes in any other variables. 
      CONCLUSION: Twelve weeks of kefir consumption improved lean body mass, depression, 
      fatigue, gastric distress, and a biomarker of gut dysbiosis. Kefir improved overall 
      and classical monocyte numbers. Kefir should be considered as a component of a 
      postexercise dietary regimen for cancer survivors.

TI  - Freeze-dried immobilized kefir culture in cider-making.
PG  - 3319-3327
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.10363 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the fermentation efficiency 
      of freeze-dried immobilized kefir culture on natural supports (apple pieces, 
      delignified cellulosic material) in cider making at various temperatures (5-45 °C) 
      in comparison with freeze-dried free cells. Freeze-dried cells were initially tested 
      in apple juice fermentations at 30 °C, and then the freeze-dried cultures produced 
      with no cryoprotectants were assessed in repeated batch fermentations. RESULTS: 
      Repeated batch fermentations lasted for longer than 5 months. High malic acid 
      conversion rates (up to 78.5%) and ethanol productivity values (up to 37.9 g L(-1) 
      day(-1) ) were recorded for freeze-dried immobilized cells. Polymerase chain 
      reaction - denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis showed that 
      freeze-drying had no effect on the microbial diversity of kefir culture. Higher 
      alcohols were significantly reduced at low fermentation temperatures. Application of 
      principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that both the fermentation temperature 
      and the nature of the freeze-dried kefir culture affected significantly the minor 
      volatiles determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Notably, all 
      ciders produced were of high quality and were accepted by the tasting panel. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Freeze-dried immobilized kefir culture on natural supports with no 
      cryoprotectants was found to be suitable for simultaneous alcoholic and malolactic 
      cider fermentation at various temperatures (5-45 °C). The high operational stability 
      of the systems was confirmed and the results obtained are of great interest for the 
      industrial sector as they could be exploited for cider, low-alcohol cider, or 'soft' 
      cider production. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is one of the most severe developmental disorders, 
      affecting on average 1 in 150 children worldwide. There is a great need for more 
      effective strategies to improve quality of life in ASD subjects. The gut microbiome 
      has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in ASD. A novel modulator of the gut 
      microbiome, the traditionally fermented milk drink kefir, has recently been shown to 
      modulate the microbiota and decrease repetitive behaviour, one of the hallmarks of 
      ASD, in mice. As such, we hypothesized that kefir could ameliorate behavioural 
      deficits in a mouse model relevant to ASD; the BTBR T(+) Itpr3(tf)/J mouse strain. 
      To this end, adult mice were administered either kefir (UK4) or a milk control for 
      three weeks as treatment lead-in, after which they were assessed for their 
      behavioural phenotype using a battery of tests. In addition, we assessed systemic 
      immunity by flow cytometry and the gut microbiome using shotgun metagenomic 
      sequencing. We found that indeed kefir decreased repetitive behaviour in this mouse 
      model. Furthermore, kefir prolonged stress-induced increases in corticosterone 
      60 min post-stress, which was accompanied by an ameliorated innate immune response 
      as measured by LY6C(hi) monocyte levels. In addition, kefir increased the levels of 
      anti-inflammatory Treg cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs). Kefir also increased 
      the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae bacterium A2, which correlated with 
      reduced repetitive behaviour and increased Treg cells in MLNs. Functionally, kefir 
      modulated various predicted gut microbial pathways, including the gut-brain module 
      S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthesis, as well as L-valine biosynthesis and pyruvate 
      fermentation to isobutanol, which all correlated with repetitive behaviour. Taken 
      together our data show that kefir modulates peripheral immunoregulation, can 
      ameliorate specific ASD behavioural dysfunctions and modulates selective aspects of 
      the composition and function of the gut microbiome, indicating that kefir 
      supplementation might prove a viable strategy in improving quality of life in ASD 
      subjects.

AB  - Kefir is a unique cultured dairy product due to combined lactic acid and alcoholic 
      fermentation of lactose in milk. Kefir is produced by microbial activity of "kefir 
      grains" which have a relatively stable and specific balance of lactic acid bacteria 
      and yeast. Due to the claimed health benefits of kefir which include reduction of 
      lactose intolerance symptoms, stimulation of the immune system, lowering 
      cholesterol, and antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic properties, kefir has become an 
      important functional dairy food and consequently, research on kefir has increased in 
      the past decade. In the following review, recent studies on the functional 
      properties of kefir are reviewed.

TI  - Homemade Kefir Consumption Improves Skin Condition-A Study Conducted in Healthy and 
      Atopic Volunteers.

AB  - Diet has a fundamental role in the homeostasis of bodily functions, including the 
      skin, which, as an essential protective barrier, plays a crucial role in this 
      balance. The skin and intestine appear to share a series of indirect metabolic 
      pathways, in a dual relationship known as the "gut-skin axis". Hence, the gut-skin 
      axis might be receptive to modulation via dietary modification, where probiotics can 
      be included, thus representing a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory skin 
      diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD), in order to control and/or ameliorate 
      symptoms. Kefir is one of the most ancient fermented foods, with probiotic 
      characteristics that have been associated with a wide variety of health-promoting 
      benefits, and it presents a microbiological diversity that makes its application as 
      a probiotic in the gut-skin relationship of the utmost interest. However, the impact 
      of a diet containing kefir on skin health has yet to be reported in scientific 
      literature. This study aimed to assess the impact of the intake of homemade kefir in 
      the skin of healthy and atopic volunteers. The intervention resulted in a boost on 
      barrier function in both skin types verified only in the respective kefir intake 
      groups. An improvement in the degree of severity of AD was also confirmed for the 
      kefir intake group. Atopic individuals may benefit from kefir intake, especially in 
      regard to their skin hydration. Finally, the effects observed on skin barrier 
      function in this study probably culminate from the effects of all the ingredients in 
      kefir, including the complex microbiota, its metabolites and macro- and 
      micronutrients resulting from the fermentation. This work opens the way for more 
      advanced research on the impact of the probiotic kefir on cutaneous health, further 
      clarifying its mechanism of action namely via gut-skin axis.

TI  - Kefir alters craniomandibular bone development in rats fed excess dose of high 
      fructose corn syrup.
PG  - 56-65
LID - 10.1007/s00774-021-01273-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dietary high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is involved in the 
      pathogenesis of oral diseases as well as metabolic diseases. The aim of this study 
      was to investigate the effects of HFCS-feeding on the craniomandibular bone 
      development at an early age and also the potential of milk kefir for preventive 
      treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, Control, Kefir, HFCS, and HFCS plus 
      Kefir groups were formed; kefir was given by gastric gavage, while HFCS (20% 
      beverages) was given in drinking water; for 8 weeks. RESULTS: Based on morphological 
      evaluations, immunohistochemical, and gene expression results, it was clearly 
      determined that excess dose of HFCS consumption decreased osteoblastic activity in 
      craniomandibular bones while increasing osteoclastic activity. However, it has been 
      determined that the intake of kefir with the HFCS-feeding greatly suppresses the 
      effects of HFCS on bone tissues. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, dietary the excess dose 
      of HFCS at an early age has been observed to pose a risk for cranial and mandible 
      bone development. The healing effects of kefir may be a new approach to the 
      treatment via kefir consumption in young's.

AB  - The gut microbiota maintains a complex mutual interaction with different organs of 
      the host. Whereas in normal conditions this natural community of trillions of 
      microorganisms greatly contributes to the human health, gut dysbiosis is related 
      with onset or worsening of diverse chronic systemic diseases. Thus, the 
      reestablishment of gut microbiota homeostasis with consumption of prebiotics and 
      probiotics may be a relevant strategy to prevent or attenuate several cardiovascular 
      and metabolic complications. Among these functional foods, the synbiotic kefir, 
      which is a fermented milk composed of a mixture of bacteria and yeasts, is currently 
      the most used and has attracted the attention of health care professionals. The 
      present review is focused on reports describing the feasibility of kefir consumption 
      to provide benefits in cardiometabolic diseases, including hypertension, vascular 
      endothelial dysfunction, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Interestingly, recent 
      studies show that mechanisms of actions of kefir in cardiometabolic diseases include 
      recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells, improvement of the balance 
      vagal/sympathetic nervous system, diminution of excessive generation of reactive 
      oxygen species, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition, anti-inflammatory 
      cytokines profile and alteration of the intestinal microbiota. These findings 
      provide a better understanding about the mechanisms of the beneficial actions of 
      kefir and motivate further investigations to determine whether the use of this 
      synbiotic could also be translated into clinical improvements in cardiometabolic 
      diseases.

AB  - Kefir drink is one of the most important probiotic products, which is made using 
      kefir microorganisms in fermenting the milk. Numerous investigation have been 
      accomplished in the field of the therapeutic property of probiotic products. In the 
      present study, we assessed the cytotoxic effect of kefir on the rate of growth and 
      increase of glioblastoma cancer cell as the most severe form of brain tumors. In 
      this experimental study, we used a U87 cancer cell line (glioblastoma). The 
      interaction between cancer cells and different concentrations of kefir drink and 
      supernatants at 24 and 48 hours was considered. The cell cytotoxicity of kefir and 
      sedimentation of cell lysate and extract of kefir was assessed using the MTT test 
      after 24 and 48 hours. The result of the MTT test, treatment of the cells with the 
      48-hour fermented drink, demonstrated the most cell cytotoxicity in comparison with 
      the control group. Results showed that the toxicity effect in all groups was 
      dose-dependent, and by increasing the concentration, cell survival decreased 
      noticeably. The results indicated that the supernatant of fermented kefir drink as a 
      probiotic product has more toxicity and lethality effect on the glioblastoma cancer 
      cell. This product can be utilized as a replacement or a complementary therapy of 
      cancer.

AB  - Sugary kefir beverage is produce by fermenting raw sugar solution with kefir grains, 
      the latter consisting of polysaccharide and microorganisms. This beverage, with 
      great consumption in countries such as USA, Japan, France, and Brazil, represents a 
      promising market to functional cultured drinks. This paper reviews the microbial 
      diversity and interaction, kinetics, safety, and bioactivities of sugary kefir 
      fermentation. The literature reviewed here demonstrates that sugary kefir possesses 
      a similar microbial association relative to traditional milk kefir fermentation, 
      especially among lactic acid bacteria and yeast species, such as Lactobacillus, 
      Leuconostoc, Kluyveromyces, Pichia, and Saccharomyces. However, a selective pressure 
      at species level is generally observed, as, for example, the stimulation of 
      Saccharomyces species metabolism, leading to a high content of alcohol in the final 
      product. This also seems to stimulate the growth of acetic acid bacteria that 
      benefit of increased ethanol production to acetic acid metabolism. Existing reports 
      have suggested important bioactivities associated with sugary kefir beverage 
      consumption, such as antimicrobial, antiedematogenic, anti-inflammatory, 
      antioxidant, cicatrizing, and healing activities. Other alternative non-dairy 
      substrates, such as fruits, vegetables, and molasses, have also been tested for 
      adaptation of kefir grains and production of functional beverages with distinct 
      sensory characteristics. This diversification is of crucial importance for the

AB  - Nutritional interventions can be valuable for the prevention of postmenopausal 
      osteoporosis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of kefir fortified with 
      omega-3 and vitamin C on the bone and uterus parameters of ovariectomized rats. 
      Seventy-seven female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized or sham-operated. The 
      ovariectomized rats were assigned to six groups and received 1 ml/day of distilled 
      water (OVX group), milk, kefir, kefir fortified with omega-3 (kefir+ω3), kefir 
      fortified with vitamin C (kefir+vit-C) or kefir fortified with omega-3 and vitamin C 
      (kefir+ω3+vit-C) for 12 weeks. The sham group also received 1ml/day of distilled 
      water. Subsequently, bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD) of 
      various bones were assessed. Femurs and uteri were harvested for bone ash analysis 
      and histopathological examinations, respectively. Sera were analyzed for 
      carboxy-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type 1 collagen, procollagen type 1 
      amino-terminal propeptide, calcium, phosphorous, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and 
      total antioxidant capacity levels. Ovariectomy resulted in significant reduction in 
      bone density (P<0.05). Kefir+ω3+vit-C significantly improved BMC of lumbar spine 
      (0.699±0.027 g compared with 0.580±0.018 in the OVX group), and kefir, kefir+vit-C 
      and kefir+ω3+vit-C significantly increased BMD of tibia (0.118±0.003 g/cm(2), 
      0.119±0.001 and 0.120±0.004 compared with 0.102±0.005 in the OVX group). Moreover, 
      ovariectomy markedly elevated TNF-α level, which was significantly reversed by 
      kefir+ω3+vit-C. Significant atrophy of the uterus was observed following 
      ovariectomy, although the uterus parameters did not change by any of the 
      interventions. In conclusion, kefir fortified with omega-3 and vitamin C may have 
      protective effects against bone loss through suppressing inflammation.

TI  - The Effects of Kefir on Kidney Tissues and Functions in Diabetic Rats.
PG  - 375-382
LID - 10.1007/s12602-020-09698-9 [doi]
AB  - This study was designed to determine the protective effect of kefir on the oxidative 
      damage, as well as histological and biochemical changes that occur in the kidney 
      tissues of experimental diabetic rats. Forty rats were allocated into four groups as 
      "healthy saline" (SF), "healthy kefir" (KF), and the same groups with experimentally 
      induced diabetes (DSF and DKF). Diabetes was induced by administering 65 mg/kg 
      single-dose streptozotocin. Oral kefir was given 10 ml/kg/day for 35 days to the 
      rats in the groups KF and DKF. The same amount of saline was given to the groups SF 
      and DSF. On the 36th day of the study, blood glucose, urea, and creatinine were 
      measured besides glucose, creatinine, microalbuminuria, and sodium in the urine. 
      Additionally, histological examination was performed on the kidney tissues. Blood 
      glucose, creatinine, and urea levels were significantly lower in the DKF group 
      compared with those of the DSF group (p < 0.001). Also, the creatinine level was 
      significantly decreased (p < 0.001), and microalbuminuria was increased (p < 0.001) 
      in the DKF group compared with that of the DSF group. Histologically, intermittent 
      expansion in the renal glomeruli, reduction of cast formation in the tubules, and 
      improvement in the renal epithelial tissues of the DKF group were observed. Kefir 
      decreased the damage caused by diabetes. These results indicate that kefir 
      supplementation may contribute to better control of oxidative stress, which is 
      related to the improvement of renal functions, suggesting its use to slow down the 
      progression of diabetic nephropathy.

AB  - Depression is a prevalent, stress-related mental disorder that can lead to serious 
      psychiatric diseases with morbidity and high mortality. Although some functional 
      fermented dairy drinks have promising anxiolytic and antidepressant effects, the 
      mechanism is still not clear. To determine the antidepressant-like effect and the 
      potential molecule mechanism of kefir peptides (KP), various behavioral tests, 
      including the elevated plus maze test, open field test, forced swimming test, and 
      tail suspension test, were used. Administration of 150 mg/kg KP in mice reduced the 
      duration of immobility in the forced swimming test and tail suspension test, 
      elevated the time spent in the open arm and center zone in the elevated plus maze 
      test, and increased the total distance traveled, average speed, and time spent in 
      the center zone in the open field test compared with the mock group. These results 
      indicated that KP dramatically ameliorated the depression-like behaviors. Kefir 
      peptides were further isolated and identified using high-performance liquid 
      chromatography and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, from which 3 
      peptides were identified and designated KFP-1, KFP-3, and KFP-5. Among these 
      peptides, administration of KFP-3 (15 AA residues) remarkably decreased immobility 
      time in the forced swimming test and increased mobility time in the tail suspension 
      test. Therefore, KFP-3 may be the major active peptide with antidepressant activity 
      in KP. Overexpression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, phosphorylated 
      tropomyosin receptor kinase B, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 protein levels could be 
      detected in the hippocampus under KP administration. Therefore, we suggest that KP 
      improves depressive-like behaviors by activating the brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor-phosphorylated tropomyosin receptor kinase B signaling pathway. Kefir 
      peptides may serve as a new type of antidepressant dairy product and may provide 
      potent antidepressant effects for clinical use.

TI  - Characterization of Kefir Produced in Household Conditions: Physicochemical and 
      Nutritional Profile, and Storage Stability.
LID - 10.3390/foods10051057 [doi]
LID - 1057
AB  - Kefir, a traditional fermented food, has numerous health benefits due to its unique 
      chemical composition, which is reflected in its excellent nutritional value. 
      Physicochemical and microbial composition of kefir obtained from fermented milk are 
      influenced by the type of the milk, grain to milk ratio, time and temperature of 
      fermentation, and storage conditions. It is crucial that kefir characteristics are 
      maintained during storage since continuous metabolic activities of residual kefir 
      microbiota may occur. This study aimed to examine the nutritional profile of kefir 
      produced in traditional in use conditions by fermentation of ultra-high temperature 
      pasteurized (UHT) semi-skimmed cow milk using argentinean kefir grains and compare 
      the stability and nutritional compliance of freshly made and refrigerated kefir. 
      Results indicate that kefir produced under home use conditions maintains the 
      expected characteristics with respect to the physicochemical parameters and 
      composition, both after fermentation and after refrigerated storage. This work 
      further contributes to the characterization of this food product that is so widely 
      consumed around the world by focusing on kefir that was produced in a typical 
      household setting.

TI  - Selected Kefir Water from Malaysia Attenuates Hydrogen Peroxide-Induced Oxidative 
      Stress by Upregulating Endogenous Antioxidant Levels in SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells.

AB  - Kefir, a fermented probiotic drink was tested for its potential anti-oxidative, 
      anti-apoptotic, and neuroprotective effects to attenuate cellular oxidative stress 
      on human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Here, the antioxidant potentials of the six 
      different kefir water samples were analysed by total phenolic content (TPC), total 
      flavonoid content (TFC), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and 
      2,2'-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) assays, whereas the anti-apoptotic 
      activity on hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) induced SH-SY5Y cells was examined using 
      MTT, AO/PI double staining, and PI/Annexin V-FITC assays. The surface and internal 
      morphological features of SH-SY5Y cells were studied using scanning and transmission 
      electron microscopy. The results indicate that Kefir B showed the higher TPC (1.96 ± 
      0.54 µg GAE/µL), TFC (1.09 ± 0.02 µg CAT eq/µL), FRAP (19.68 ± 0.11 mM FRAP eq/50 
      µL), and DPPH (0.45 ± 0.06 mg/mL) activities compared to the other kefir samples. 
      The MTT and PI/Annexin V-FITC assays showed that Kefir B pre-treatment at 10 mg/mL 
      for 48 h resulted in greater cytoprotection (97.04%), and a significantly lower 
      percentage of necrotic cells (7.79%), respectively. The Kefir B pre-treatment also 
      resulted in greater protection to cytoplasmic and cytoskeleton inclusion, along with 
      the conservation of the surface morphological features and the overall integrity of 
      SH-SY5Y cells. Our findings indicate that the anti-oxidative, anti-apoptosis, and 
      neuroprotective effects of kefir were mediated via the upregulation of SOD and 
      catalase, as well as the modulation of apoptotic genes (Tp73, Bax, and Bcl-2).

AB  - Quark cheese is a fermented soft fresh cheese categorised under acid-rennet 
      coagulated cheeses. In this study, alternative raw materials such as kefir and yayik 
      buttermilk were used to produce Quark cheese in comparison with the cheese produced 
      by the acidification of skim milk with mesophilic lactic culture. Samples were kept 
      individually under 35 °C and 100 °C for coagulum formation. Obtained cheeses, were 
      evaluated in terms of some physicochemical, microbiological and sensorial properties 
      in addition to the volatile and peptide profiles. Quark produced from kefir and 
      buttermilk was determined to have preferred properties directly affect the cheese 
      characteristics.

TI  - The antiproliferative effect of kefir cell-free fraction on HuT-102 malignant T 
      lymphocytes.
PG  - S198-203
LID - 10.3816/CLM.2009.s.012 [doi]
AB  - Kefir is produced by adding kefir grains (a mass of proteins, polysaccharides, 
      bacteria, and yeast) to pasteurized milk; it has been shown to control several 
      cellular types of cancer, such as Sarcoma 180 in mice, Lewis lung carcinoma, and 
      human mammary cancer. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is the 
      causative agent of adult T-cell leukemia, which is a fatal disease with no effective 
      treatment. The current study aims at investigating the effect of a cell-free 
      fraction of kefir on HuT-102 cells, which are HTLV-1-positive malignant 
      T-lymphocytes. Cells were incubated with different kefir concentrations: the 
      cytotoxicity of the compound was evaluated by determining the percentage viability 
      of cells. The effect of all the noncytotoxic concentrations of kefir cell-free 
      fraction on the proliferation of HuT-102 cells was then assessed. The levels of 
      transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha mRNA upon kefir treatment were then analyzed 
      using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Finally, the growth 
      inhibitory effects of kefir on cell cycle progression and/or apoptosis were assessed 
      by flow cytometry. The maximum cytotoxicity recorded at 80 microg/microL for 48 
      hours was only 43%. The percent reduction in proliferation was very significant, 
      dose and time dependent, and reached 98% upon 60-microg/microL treatment for 24 
      hours. Kefir cell-free fraction caused the downregulation of TGF-alpha, which is a 
      cytokine that induces the proliferation and replication of cells. Finally, a marked 
      increase in cell cycle distribution was noted in the pre-G1 phase. In conclusion, 
      kefir is effective in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of 
      HTLV-1-positive malignant T-lymphocytes. Therefore, further in vivo investigation is 
      highly recommended.

TI  - Enhancement of the Antibacterial Properties of Kefir by Adding Lactobacillus 
      fermentum grx08.
PG  - 1463-1471
LID - 10.4315/JFP-21-113 [doi]
AB  - ABSTRACT: Kefir is an acidic-alcoholic fermented milk that can provide probiotic 
      benefits, such as intestinal microecological balance regulation, antibacterial 
      activity, and anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, Lactobacillus fermentum 
      grx08 isolated from longevous people was used to further improve the health 
      properties of kefir. L. fermentum grx08 and kefir grains obtained from Xinjiang, 
      People's Republic of China, were mixed at ratios of 1:1, 5:1, and 25:1 as starters. 
      The six gram-positive and gram-negative foodborne pathogens were able to grow in the 
      supernatant of kefir but not in the supernatant of kefir with L. fermentum grx08. 
      With increasing amounts of inoculated L. fermentum grx08, the antibacterial activity 
      of the mixed fermented kefir gradually increased. The contents of lactic acid, 
      fumaric acid, and malic acid in the mixed fermented milk were significantly 
      increased by adding L. fermentum grx08 (P < 0.05), while the content of acetic acid 
      decreased with the increase of L. fermentum grx08 and the content of citric acid was 
      unaffected. This study suggests that the addition of L. fermentum grx08 shortened 
      the fermentation time, improved the acidity, and retained the quality of fermented 
      milk. Moreover, the antibacterial properties of kefir is enhanced by increasing the 
      production of certain acids.

TI  - Proteomic characterization of kefir milk by two-dimensional electrophoresis followed 
      by mass spectrometry.
PG  - e4635
LID - 10.1002/jms.4635 [doi]
AB  - Kefir is a type of fermented milk obtained thanks to the introduction of "kefir 
      grains" in mammalian milk. Kefir grains consist of lactic and acetic acid bacteria 
      and yeasts in alternative proportions that are held together by a matrix of complex 
      sugars known as "kefiran." Thanks to the fermentative process, the kefir milk is 
      rich in nutraceutical substances such as amino acids, vitamins, and mineral salts. 
      The most valuable compounds of kefir fermentation are mainly lactic acid, 
      exopolysaccharides, and bioactive peptides, the resulting products of proteolytic 
      release from milk proteins (caseins and whey proteins). Among the nutraceutical 
      properties of kefir are antimicrobial and antitumor activity, immunomodulating 
      effect, and cholesterol-lowering effect. Therefore, in light of these intriguing 
      properties of kefir milk, in this work, a proteomic analysis, by two-dimensional 
      electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry, has been performed. As a result, 
      milk-derived polypeptides were identified in commercial kefir milk from organic 
      farming. In particular, polypeptides deriving from κ-, α(s1) -, and α(s2) -caseins 
      that may have potentially beneficial effects on human health have been detected.

AB  - Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the tooth-supporting 
      tissues. This study evaluated the anti-inflammatory and antiresorptive effects of 
      milk kefir (MK) on periodontitis in rats. Micro-Raman spectroscopy was performed on 
      MK at different fermentation times to verify the presence of Lactobacillus kefiri. 
      From these results, Wistar rats were divided into the following groups: C (Control); 
      EP (experimental periodontitis); K1 (animals that received MK with one day of 
      fermentation); K1+EP; K4 (animals without EP using MK with four days of 
      fermentation) and K4+EP. MK was administered 28 days before EP induction and during 
      the disease development period (11 days). On day 28, in the EP groups, periodontitis 
      was induced. The animals were euthanized on day 39. The hemimaxillae were removed 
      and the following parameters were evaluated: micro-Raman analysis of the presence of 
      inflammation; histomorphometric analysis to quantify alveolar bone loss and 
      immunohistochemistry for IL-6, TNF-α, IL-Iβ and IL-10 in the periodontal ligament. 
      Micro-Raman analysis showed that four days fermentation MK has a higher intensity 
      spectrum of L. kefiri. Furthermore, the administration of this probiotic reduced the 
      intensity of the inflammation spectrum when compared to one day fermentation MK. It 
      was observed that the animals from the K4+EP group showed significant reduction of 
      alveolar bone loss, as well as a lower IL-6, TNF-α and IL-Iβ immunoexpression and a 
      higher IL-10 immunoexpression, when compared to EP groups. We conclude that MK has 
      anti-inflammatory and antiresorptive effects on periodontitis in rats and that these 
      effects are fermentation time dependent.

TI  - Effect of Different Kefir Source on Fermentation, Aerobic Stability, and Microbial 
      Community of Alfalfa Silage.
LID - 10.3390/ani11072096 [doi]
LID - 2096
AB  - The present study has been one of the first attempts to thoroughly examine the 
      effects of different kefir sources on fermentation characteristics, aerobic 
      stability, and microbial communities of alfalfa silages. The effects of commercial 
      kefir (CK) and homemade kefir culture (HK) applied with untreated a common control 
      (CON) and three different application doses (5.0, 5.7, and 6.0 log cfu g(-1)) on 
      wilted alfalfa and stored at an ambient temperature of 25-30 °C are studied. After 
      45 days of ensiling, fermentation characteristics and aerobic stability of silages 
      were measured, and bacterial diversity was investigated by 16S ribosomal RNA gene 
      sequencing using the GenomeLab™ GeXP platform. Both CK and HK accelerate more lactic 
      acid production and reduced ammonia nitrogen concentration. Factor analysis of kefir 
      sources suggests that the addition of kefir improves the aerobic stability of 
      silages, even the initial water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content is inadequate via 
      its antimicrobial effect on yeast and mold formation. Enterococcus faecium, 
      Pediococcus pentosaceous and Lactobacillus brevis were dominant bacterial species 
      among the treated groups at silo opening, while Lactobacillus plantarum and 
      Lactobacillus brevis became dominant bacterial species after 7 days of aerobic 
      exposure. In conclusion, the application of kefir on alfalfa silages improves 
      fermentation quality and aerobic stability even with low WSC content.

TI  - Kefir treatment ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in rats.
PG  - 13020-9
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v21.i46.13020 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To investigate the preventive effect of kefir on colitis induced with dextran 
      sulfate sodium (DSS) in rats. METHODS: Twenty-four male Wistar-albino rats were 
      randomized into four groups: normal control, kefir-control, colitis, and 
      kefir-colitis groups. Rats in the normal and kefir-control groups were administered 
      tap water as drinking water for 14 d. Rats in the colitis and kefir-colitis groups 
      were administered a 3% DSS solution as drinking water for 8-14 d to induce colitis. 
      Rats in the kefir-control and kefir-colitis groups were administered 5 mL kefir once 
      a day for 14 d while rats in the normal control and colitis group were administered 
      an identical volume of the placebo (skim milk) using an orogastric feeding tube. 
      Clinical colitis was evaluated with reference to the disease activity index (DAI), 
      based on daily weight loss, stool consistency, and presence of bleeding in feces. 
      Rats were sacrificed on the 15(th) day, blood specimens were collected, and colon 
      tissues were rapidly removed. Levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), tumor necrosis factor 
      (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-10, malondialdehyde, and inducible nitric oxide synthase 
      (iNOS) were measured in colon tissue. RESULTS: The DAI was lower in the 
      kefir-colitis group than in the colitis group (on the 3(rd) and 5(th) days of 
      colitis induction; P < 0.01). The DAI was also significantly higher in the colitis 
      group between days 2 and 6 of colitis induction when compared to the normal control 
      and kefir-control groups. The DAI was statistically higher only on the 6(th) day in 
      the kefir-colitis group when compared to that in the normal control groups. 
      Increased colon weight and decreased colon length were observed in colitis-induced 
      rats. Mean colon length in the colitis group was significantly shorter than that of 
      the kefir-control group. Kefir treatment significantly decreased histologic colitis 
      scores (P < 0.05). MPO activity in the colitis group was significantly higher than 
      in the kefir-control group (P < 0.05). Kefir treatment significantly reduced the DSS 
      colitis-induced TNF-α increase (P < 0.01). No statistically significant differences 
      were observed among groups for IL-10 and MDA levels. Colon tissue iNOS levels in the 
      colitis group were significantly higher than those in the control and kefir-colitis 
      groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Kefir reduces the clinical DAI and histologic colitis 
      scores in a DSS-induced colitis model, possibly via reduction of MPO, TNF-α, and 
      iNOS levels.

TI  - The Effect of Kefir Supplementation on Improving Human Endurance Exercise 
      Performance and Antifatigue.
LID - 10.3390/metabo11030136 [doi]
LID - 136
AB  - Kefir is an acidic, carbonated, and fermented dairy product produced by fermenting 
      milk with kefir grains. The Lactobacillus species constitutes an important part of 
      kefir grains. In a previous animal study, kefir effectively improved exercise 
      performance and had anti-fatigue effects. The purpose of this research was to 
      explore the benefits of applying kefir to improve exercise performance, reduce 
      fatigue, and improve physiological adaptability in humans. The test used a 
      double-blind crossover design and supplementation for 28 days. Sixteen 20-30 
      year-old subjects were divided into two groups in a balanced order according to each 
      individual's initial maximal oxygen uptake and were assigned to receive a placebo 
      (equal flavor, equal calories, 20 g/day) or SYNKEFIR™ (20 g/day) every morning. 
      After the intervention, there were 28 days of wash-out, during which time the 
      subjects did not receive further interventions. After supplementation with 
      SYNKEFIR™, the exercise time to exhaustion was significantly greater than that 
      before ingestion (p = 0.0001) and higher than that in the Placebo group by 1.29-fold 
      (p = 0.0004). In addition, compared with the Placebo group, the SYNKEFIR™ 
      administration group had significantly lower lactate levels in the exercise and 
      recovery (p < 0.05). However, no significant difference was observed in the changes 
      in the gut microbiota. Although no significant changes in body composition were 
      found, SYNKEFIR™ did not cause adverse reactions or harm to the participants' 
      bodies. In summary, 28 days of supplementation with SYNKEFIR™ significantly improved 
      exercise performance, reduced the production of lactic acid after exercise, and 
      accelerated recovery while also not causing any adverse reactions.

AB  - In the past decade, the high morbidity and mortality of atherosclerotic disease have 
      been prevalent worldwide. High-fat food consumption has been suggested to be an 
      overarching factor for atherosclerosis incidence. This study aims to investigate the 
      effects of kefir peptides on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced atherosclerosis in 
      apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE(-/-)) mice. 7-week old male ApoE(-/-) and normal 
      C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into five groups (n = 8). Atherosclerotic lesion 
      development in ApoE(-/-) mice was established after fed the HFD for 12 weeks 
      compared to standard chow diet (SCD)-fed C57BL/6 and ApoE(-/-) control groups. Kefir 
      peptides oral administration significantly improved atherosclerotic lesion 
      development by protecting against endothelial dysfunction, decreasing oxidative 
      stress, reducing aortic lipid deposition, attenuating macrophage accumulation, and 
      suppressing the inflammatory immune response compared with the HFD/ApoE(-/-) mock 
      group. Moreover, the high dose of kefir peptides substantially inhibited aortic 
      fibrosis and restored the fibrosis in the aorta root close to that observed in the 
      C57BL/6 normal control group. Our findings show, for the first time, 
      anti-atherosclerotic progression via kefir peptides consumption in HFD-fed ApoE(-/-) 
      mice. The profitable effects of kefir peptides provide new perspectives for its use 
      as an anti-atherosclerotic agent in the preventive medicine.

TI  - Preventive oral kefir supplementation protects mice from ovariectomy-induced 
      exacerbated allergic airway inflammation.

AB  - Asthma is an inflammatory lung disease that affects more women than men in 
      adulthood. Clinical evidence shows that hormonal fluctuation during the menstrual 
      cycle and menopause are related to increased asthma severity in women. Considering 
      that life expectancy has increased and that most women now undergo menopause, 
      strategies to prevent the worsening of asthma symptoms are particularly important. A 
      recent study from our group showed that re-exposure of ovariectomised allergic mice 
      to antigen (ovalbumin) leads to an exacerbation of lung inflammation that is similar 
      to clinical conditions. However, little is known about the role of probiotics in the 
      prevention of asthma exacerbations during the menstrual cycle or menopause. Thus, 
      our objective was to evaluate the effects of supplementation with kefir, a popular 
      fermented dairy beverage, as a preventive strategy for modulating allergic disease. 
      The results show that the preventive kefir administration decreases the influx of 
      inflammatory cells in the airways and exacerbates the production of mucus and the 
      interleukin 13 cytokine. Additionally, kefir changes macrophage polarisation by 
      decreasing the number of M2 macrophages, as shown by RT-PCR assay. Thus, kefir is a 
      functional food that potentially prevents allergic airway inflammation exacerbations 
      in ovariectomised mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, researchers are interested in the discovery of active 
      compounds from traditional remedies and natural sources, as they reveal higher 
      therapeutic efficacies and improved toxicological profiles. Among the various 
      traditional treatments that have been widely studied and explored for their 
      potential therapeutic benefits, kefir, a fermented beverage, demonstrates a broad 
      spectrum of pharmacological properties, including antioxidant, anti-inflammation, 
      and healing activities. These health-promoting properties of kefir vary among the 
      kefir cultures found at the different part of the world as different media and 
      culture conditions are used for kefir maintenance and fermentation. METHODS: This 
      study investigated the microbial composition and readily found bioactive compounds 
      in water kefir fermented in Malaysia using 16S rRNA microbiome and UHPLC sequencing 
      approaches. The toxicity effects of the kefir water administration in BALB/c mice 
      were analysed based on the mice survival, body weight index, biochemistry profile, 
      and histopathological changes. The antioxidant activities were evaluated using SOD, 
      FRAP, and NO assays. RESULTS: The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing revealed the most 
      abundant species found in the water kefir was Lactobacillus hilgardii followed by 
      Lactobacillus harbinensis, Acetobacter lovaniensis, Lactobacillus satsumensis, 
      Acetobacter tropicalis, Lactobacillus zeae, and Oenococcus oeni. The UHPLC screening 
      showed flavonoid and phenolic acid derivatives as the most important bioactive 
      compounds present in kefir water which has been responsible for its antioxidant 
      activities. Subchronic toxicity study showed no toxicological signs, behavioural 
      changes, or adverse effects by administrating 10 mL/kg/day and 2.5 mL/kg/day kefir 
      water to the mice. Antioxidants assays demonstrated enhanced SOD and FRAP activities 
      and reduced NO level, especially in the brain and kidney samples. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study will help to intensify the knowledge on the water kefir microbial composition, 
      available phytochemicals and its toxicological and antioxidant effects on BALB/c 
      mice since there are very limited studies on the water kefir grain fermented in 
      Malaysia.

AB  - Kefir consumption has been demonstrated to improve lipid and cholesterol metabolism; 
      however, our previous study identified that benefits vary between different 
      commercial and traditional kefir. Here, we investigate the ability of pitched 
      culture kefir, that is, kefir produced by a small number of specific strains, to 
      recapitulate health benefits of a traditional kefir, in a diet-induced obesity mouse 
      model, and examine how microbial composition of kefir impacts these benefits. 
      Eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (40 % energy from fat) 
      supplemented with one of five kefir varieties (traditional, pitched, pitched with no 
      Lactobacillus, pitched with no yeast and commercial control) at 2 ml in 20 g of food 
      for 8 weeks prior to analysis of plasma and liver lipid profiles, and liver gene 
      expression profiles related to lipid metabolism. Both traditional and pitched kefir 
      lowered plasma cholesterol by about 35 % (P = 0·0005) and liver TAG by about 55 % (P 
      = 0·0001) when compared with commercial kefir despite no difference in body weight. 
      Furthermore, pitched kefir produced without either yeast or Lactobacillus did not 
      lower cholesterol. The traditional and pitched kefir with the full complement of 
      microbes were able to impart corresponding decreases in the expression of the 
      cholesterol and lipid metabolism genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme 
      A reductase, PPARγ and CD36 in the liver. These results demonstrate that traditional 
      kefir organisms can successfully be utilised in a commercial process, while 
      highlighting the importance of microbial interactions during fermentation in the 
      ability of fermented foods to benefit host health.

AB  - Kefir is a traditional fermented milk originating in the Caucasus area and parts of 
      Eastern Europe. In this study, the kefir culture, which is modified upon the 
      addition of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cells, specifically for soymilk kefir 
      fermentation with the highest capacity of isoflavone biotransformation, was 
      successfully produced, and the metagenomics composition of soymilk or milk fermented 
      using these kefir cultures was investigated. The metagenome analysis showed that the 
      microbiota of kefir in M-K (milk inoculated with kefir), SM-K (equal volumes of 
      soymilk and milk inoculated with kefir), and S-K (pure milk inoculated with kefir) 
      were related to the addition of soymilk or not. Furthermore, the HPLC chromatogram 
      revealed that Guixia 2 (Guangzhou, China) may be a good source of soymilk kefir 
      fermentation due to its high isoflavone aglycone content (90.23 ± 1.26 μg/g in 
      daidzein, 68.20 ± 0.74 μg/g in genistein). Importantly, the starter culture created 
      by adding 1.5 g probiotics (Biostime®, Guangzhou, China) to Chinese kefir showed a 
      significant increase in the levels of isoflavone aglycones (72.07 ± 0.53 μg/g in 
      isoflavone aglycones). These results provided insight into understanding the 
      suitable soybean cultivar and starter cultures, which exhibit promising results of 
      isoflavone biotransformation and flavor promotion during soymilk kefir fermentation.

AB  - Emojis can be used to explore food-evoked emotions in order to provide information 
      that can support the product development and marketing decisions. This study aimed 
      to evaluate consumers' acceptance, purchase intent and emotional responses to milk 
      beverages, with and without kefir added, before and after these consumers were 
      informed about the products' composition (0%, 15%, 30% and 50% m/v) and health 
      claims toward kefir (blind and informed tests, respectively). Emotional responses 
      were assessed by emoji use within a RATA questionnaire in order quantify the 
      perceived significance of the emojis chosen. In the informed test, the consumers' 
      perception of the sensory attributes of the milk beverages, such as their perception 
      of an acid taste in added kefir beverages was shown to have changed. Overall, 
      participants attributed significantly higher acceptance and purchase intent scores 
      to added kefir beverages after they had been informed on its health benefits. In 
      addition, expressions of positive emotion increased when participants were exposed 
      to stimuli related to health benefits of kefir (15%, 30% and 50% m/v), while 
      negative expressions of emotion decreased. The provided information of kefir 
      modified valence and arousal in subjects, and it can be said that to 30% of kefir 
      can be added to yogurt without compromising its sensory acceptability. Thus, health 
      benefits alone cannot improve product acceptance, since participants found a 50% 
      addition of kefir to be unpleasant when tasted during a blind test. Mixed beverages 
      may present a probiotic beverage alternative for consumers who dislike kefir milk, 
      but want to include it in their diets. The implications of liking and purchase 
      intent and how they are linked to emotions are discussed in this paper as well.

TI  - Anti-biofilm potential of kefir-derived Lactobacillus paracasei L10 against Vibrio 
      parahaemolyticus.
PG  - 750-758
LID - 10.1111/lam.13568 [doi]
AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a kind of biofilm-forming foodborne bacterium, presents 
      formidable challenges to the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents. Increasingly, 
      the safety of chemical antimicrobials has aroused the widespread attention of the 
      public. The development of the novel nature antimicrobial agents has become critical 
      for controlling biofilm-related pollution and infections. In this paper, we 
      investigated the antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus paracasei L10, and 
      evaluated the inhibition and eradication effects of the cell-free supernatant (CFS) 
      of the strain on V. parahaemolyticus biofilms in detail. We found that the CFS 
      exhibited marked antibacterial activity against all tested pathogenic bacteria. In 
      co-cultural assay, L. paracasei L10 could notably reduce cell viability in both 
      plankton and biofilm of V. parahaemolyticus and this antagonism effect in biofilm 
      was greater than that in planktonic state. Meanwhile, the growth of V. 
      parahaemolyticus was completely inhibited when 6% (v/v) of the CFS was added, and 
      the supernatant also showed a concentration-dependent manner to inhibit and 
      eradicate the biofilms of V. parahaemolyticus while decreased the metabolic activity 
      of the biofilm in the same way. Moreover, the fluorescence microscopic and confocal 
      laser scanning microscopy images confirmed the anti-biofilm activity of the CFS. 
      This study elucidates that L. paracasei L10 displays a significant anti-biofilm 
      effect on V. parahaemolyticus and the mechanism of its antagonism merits further 
      study, which provides theoretical support for further development and application of 
      L. paracasei L10 as anti-biofilm agents.

AB  - In recent years, the fermented milk product kefir has been intensively studied 
      because of its health benefits. Here, we evaluated the microbial consortia of two 
      kefir samples, from Escarcega, Campeche, and Campeche (México). We considered a 
      functional comparison between both samples, including fungal and bacterial 
      inhibition; second, we applied shotgun metagenomics to assess the structure and 
      functional diversity of the communities of microorganisms. These two samples 
      exhibited antagonisms against bacterial and fungal pathogens. Bioactive polyketides 
      and nonribosomal peptides were identified by LC-HRMS analysis. We also observed a 
      high bacterial diversity and an abundance of Actinobacteria in both kefir samples, 
      and a greater abundance of Saccharomyces species in kefir of Escarcega than in the 
      Campeche kefir. When the prophage compositions were evaluated, the Campeche sample 
      showed a higher diversity of prophage sequences. In Escarcega, we observed a 
      prevalence of prophage families that infect Enterobacteria and Lactobacillus. The 
      sequences associated with secondary metabolites, such as plipastatin, fengycin, and 
      bacillaene, and also bacteriocins like helveticin and zoocin, were also found in 
      different proportions, with greater diversity in the Escarcega sample. The analyses 
      described in this work open the opportunity to understand the microbial diversity in 
      kefir samples from two distant localities.

TI  - AB-Kefir Reduced Body Weight and Ameliorated Inflammation in Adipose Tissue of Obese

AB  - Consumption of different types of high-calorie foods leads to the development of 
      various metabolic disorders. However, the effects of multi-strain probiotics on 
      different types of diet-induced obesity and intestinal dysbiosis remain unclear. In 
      this study, mice were fed a control diet, high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal fat and 20% 
      kcal carbohydrate), or western diet (WD; 40% kcal fat and 43% kcal carbohydrate) and 
      administered with multi-strain AB-Kefir containing six strains of lactic acid 
      bacteria and a Bifidobacterium strain, at 10(9) CFU per mouse for 10 weeks. Results 
      demonstrated that AB-Kefir reduced body weight gain, glucose intolerance, and 
      hepatic steatosis with a minor influence on gut microbiota composition in HFD-fed 
      mice, but not in WD-fed mice. In addition, AB-Kefir significantly reduced the weight 
      and size of adipose tissues by regulating the expression of CD36, Igf1, and Pgc1 in 
      HFD-fed mice. Although AB-Kefir did not reduce the volume of white adipose tissue, 
      it markedly regulated CD36, Dgat1 and Mogat1 mRNA expression. Moreover, the 
      abundance of Eubacterium_coprostanoligenes_group and Ruminiclostridium significantly 
      correlated with changes in body weight, liver weight, and fasting glucose in test 
      mice. Overall, this study provides important evidence to understand the interactions 
      between probiotics, gut microbiota, and diet in obesity treatment.

TI  - Water Kefir and Derived Pasteurized Beverages Modulate Gut Microbiota, Intestinal 
      Permeability and Cytokine Production In Vitro.

AB  - Fermentation is an ancient food preservation process, and fermented products have 
      been traditionally consumed in different cultures worldwide over the years. The 
      interplay between human gut microbiota, diet and host health is widely recognized. 
      Diet is one of the main factors modulating gut microbiota potentially with 
      beneficial effects on human health. Fermented dairy products have received much 
      attention, but other sources of probiotic delivery through food received far less 
      attention. In this research, a combination of in vitro tools mimicking colonic 
      fermentation and the intestinal epithelium have been applied to study the effect of 
      different pasteurized and non-pasteurized water kefir products on gut microbiota, 
      epithelial barrier function and immunomodulation. Water kefir increased beneficial 
      short-chain fatty acid production at the microbial level, reduced detrimental 
      proteolytic fermentation compounds and increased Bifidobacterium genus abundance. 
      The observed benefits are enhanced by pasteurization. Pasteurized products also had 
      a significant effect at the host level, improving inflammation-induced intestinal 
      epithelial barrier disruption and increasing IL-10 and IL-1β compared to the control 
      condition. Our data support the potential health benefits of water kefir and 
      demonstrate that pasteurization, performed to prolong shelf life and stability of 
      the product, also enhanced these benefits.

TI  - Chemical Constitution and Antimicrobial Activity of Kefir Fermented Beverage.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26092635 [doi]
LID - 2635
AB  - Kefir beverage (KB) is a fermented milk initiated by kefir grains rich with starter 
      probiotics. The KB produced in this study seemed to contain many chemical compounds 
      elucidated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and IR spectra. These 
      compounds could be classified into different chemical groups such as alcohols, 
      phenols, esters, fatty esters, unsaturated fatty esters, steroids, polyalkenes, 
      heterocyclic compounds and aromatic aldehydes. Both KB and neutralized kefir 
      beverage (NKB) inhibited some pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli 
      ATCC11229 (E. coli), Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 4957 (L. monocytogenes), Bacillus 
      cereus ATCC 14579 (B. cereus), Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 14028 (Sal. typhimurium) 
      as well as some tested fungal strains such as Aspergillus flavus ATCC 16872 (A. 
      flavus) and Aspergillus niger ATCC 20611 (A. niger), but the inhibitory activity of 
      KB was more powerful than that obtained by NKB. It also appeared to contain four 
      lactic acid bacteria species, one acetic acid bacterium and two yeast species. 
      Finally, the KB inhibited distinctively both S. aureus and Sal. typhimurium bacteria 
      in a brain heart infusion broth and in some Egyptian fruit juices, including those 
      made with apples, guava, strawberries and tomatoes.

AB  - Increased intestinal permeability has been shown to be involved in several diseases 
      associated with low-grade chronic inflammation, including obesity and metabolic 
      syndrome. In the last decade, growing evidence shows the beneficial effects of 
      probiotic-containing food supplementation on these conditions. In this crossover 
      intervention study on 28 asymptomatic overweight adults, we tested the effects of a 
      3-wk kefir supplementation compared with a 3-wk milk supplementation on serum 
      zonulin levels. The effects on serum glucose, triacylglycerols, low-density 
      lipoproteins, high-density lipoproteins, total cholesterol, markers of inflammation 
      (C-reactive protein and adiponectin), anthropometric variables, mood, and appetite 
      were also determined. Kefir supplementation resulted in a greater improvement of 
      serum zonulin levels (F = 6.812, η(2) = 0.275), whereas a significant yet similar 
      improvement in lipid profile and serum glucose levels was found in both 
      supplementations. Positive mood was slightly but significantly enhanced with kefir 
      supplementation, and reduced with milk supplementation. The C-reactive protein, 
      adiponectin, and appetite were unaffected. In conclusion, supplementation with both 
      dairy products had health beneficial effects, but only kefir showed an effect on the 
      intestinal barrier dysfunction marker.

LID - 14552
AB  - Kluyveromyces marxianus is a yeast that could be identified from kefir and can use a 
      broad range of substrates, such as glucose and lactate, as carbon sources. The 
      lactate produced in kefir culture can be a substrate for K. marxianus. However, the 
      complexity of the kefir microbiota makes the traits of K. marxianus difficult to 
      study. In this research, we focused on K. marxianus cultured with lactate as the 
      sole carbon source. The optimal growth and released protein in lactate culture were 
      determined under different pH conditions, and the LC-MS/MS-identified proteins were 
      associated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycolysis pathway, and cellular 
      stress responses in cells, indicating that autolysis of K. marxianus had occurred 
      under the culture conditions. The abundant glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
      1 (GAP1) was cocrystallized with other proteins in the cell-free fraction, and the 
      low transcription level of the GAP1 gene indicated that the protein abundance under 
      autolysis conditions was dependent on protein stability. These results suggest that 
      lactate induces the growth and autolysis of K. marxianus, releasing proteins and 
      peptides. These findings can be fundamental for K. marxianus probiotic and kefir 
      studies in the future.

AB  - Deltamethrine (DLM) is a synthetic pyrethroid with broad spectrum activities against 
      acaricides and insects. Widely used for agricultural and veterinary purposes, its 
      human and animal exposure occurs by ingestion of contaminated water and food and 
      leads to serious health problems. Kefir is fermented milk with numerous health 
      favors counting restorative properties of bacterial flora, immune system 
      stimulation, cholesterol reduction, as well as anti-mutagenic and anti-tumor 
      properties. The present study was undertaken to examine the hepatoprotective and 
      antioxidant potential of kefir against DLM toxicity in male Wistar albino rats. 
      DLM-treated animals revealed a significant increase in serum biochemical parameters 
      as well as hepatic protein and lipid oxidations but caused an inhibition in 
      antioxidant enzymes. Additionally, we have observed an increase in hepatocyte DNA 
      damages. This toxic effect was confirmed by histological study. Kefir administration 
      normalized the elevated serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine 
      aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin (T bilirubin), and cholesterol. It also 
      reduced DLM-induced protein carbonyl (PC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) formations. 
      Furthermore, Kefir treatment restored catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
      activities. The co-treatment as well as the pre-treatment by kefir showed an 
      improvement of oxidative status as well as suppressed inflammation and DNA damages. 
      However, the pre-treatment seems to be the most efficient. Therefore, it could be 
      concluded that kefir is a natural product able to protect against the hepatotoxic 
      effects of DLM by its free radical-scavenging and potent antioxidant activity.

AB  - Functional foods are foods that, in addition to having nutrients, contain in their 
      composition ingredients that act specifically on body functions associated with the 
      control and reduction of the risk of developing some diseases. In this sense, kefir, 
      a group of microorganisms in symbiosis, mainly yeasts and lactic acid bacteria, 
      stands out. The trend of ingesting kefir has been focused on the development of 
      products that serve specific consumers, such as those who are lactose-intolerant, 
      vegans and vegetarians, and consumers in general who seek to combine the consumption 
      of functional products with the improvement of their health and lifestyle. This 
      overview provides an insight into kefir, presenting the technological process to 
      produce a nondairy beverage and evidence of the benefits of its use to reduce the 
      risk of disease. We also discuss regulatory aspects of products fermented using 
      kefir. Until now, the use of kefir (isolated microorganism, kefiran, or fermented 
      product) has demonstrated the potential to promote an increase in the number of 
      bifidobacteria in the colon and an increase in the glycemic control while reducing 
      the blood cholesterol and balancing the intestinal microbiota, which helps in 
      reducing constipation and diarrhea, improving intestinal permeability, and 
      stimulating and balancing the immune system. However, the literature still has gaps 
      that need to be clarified, such as the consumption dose of kefir or its products to 
      cause some health benefit.

TI  - Tibet Kefir Milk Regulated Metabolic Changes Induced by High-Fat Diet via Amino 
      Acids, Bile Acids, and Equol Metabolism in Human-Microbiota-Associated Rats.
PG  - 6720-6732
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.1c02430 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to confirm the effects of Tibet kefir milk (TKM) on gut microbiota 
      and metabolism. An obesity model was established by feeding a high-fat diet (HFD) to 
      human-microbiota-associated rats. Next-generation sequencing and 
      ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass 
      spectrometry were applied for gut microbiota and untargeted metabolomics, 
      respectively. After 8 weeks of feeding, the enterotype in the HFD group was switched 
      from ET1 (Prevotella/Akkermansia-dominant) to ET2 
      (Bacteroides/Akkermansia-dominant). Branched-chain amino-acids- and aromatic 
      amino-acids-metabolism increased, and taurine-conjugated bile acids decreased in the 
      HFD group. Compared with the HFD group, taurocholic acid increased in the TKM1 
      group, while l-threonine decreased, and equol, taurochenodeoxycholate, and 
      taurodeoxycholic acid increased in the TKM2 group. The metabolite alteration 
      suggested restorative bile acid metabolism, modified metabolic pattern of amino 
      acids, and elevation of anti-obesity factors in the TKM-intervened animals. It can 
      be deduced that changes by TKM intervention in the host gut metabolites are the 
      major contributors to reducing fat deposition.

TI  - Supplementation of kefir ameliorates azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium induced 
      colorectal cancer by modulating the gut microbiota.
PG  - 11641-11655
LID - 10.1039/d1fo01729b [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of kefir on colorectal cancer 
      (CRC) via regulating the microbiota structure in the colon using the 
      azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium (AOM/DSS) induced CRC mouse model. Mice in the 
      treatment group were orally administered with milk or kefir. The gut microbiota 
      composition was assessed by internally transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and 16S rRNA 
      high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore, the biomarkers associated with the gut 
      barrier, inflammation, and cell proliferation regulators were evaluated. The results 
      indicated that the size and the amount of tumor were decreased and the immunity 
      regulators (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17a) and oncocyte proliferation indicator (Ki67, 
      NF-κB, and β-catenin) were all decreased. Increased short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) 
      lowered the pH in the colon and helped enhance the intestinal barrier. The 
      Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and Ascomycota/Basidiomycota ratio were decreased at 
      the phylum level; the relative abundance of probiotics was increased and the 
      pathogenic bacterium (Clostridium sensu stricto, Aspergillus and Talaromyces) were 
      decreased after supplementation of kefir. Consequently, kefir could regulate the gut 
      microbiota composition and ameliorate AOM/DSS induced colorectal cancer.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the sensory acceptance and emotional 
      profile of sheep milk kefir sweetened with different sugars (demerara sugar, brown 
      sugar, fructose, coconut sugar, and honey, 100 g/L). Consumers (n = 100) assessed 
      sensory acceptance (appearance, aroma, taste, texture, and overall impression), and 
      expressed their emotions (satisfied, active, loving, calm, comfortable, energetic, 
      happy, healthy, refreshing, disgusted, worried, and upset). The emotions 
      "satisfied," "active," "comfortable," "energetic," "healthy," and "refreshing" were 
      found between moderate and very high levels, indicating that they are important 
      emotions for the characterization and sensory acceptance of kefir samples. The use 
      of different sugars had no influence on the intensity of the emotions "calm," 
      "comfortable," "happy," or "disgusted," and resulted in a greater sense of 
      satisfaction. The use of demerara sugar or fructose did not alter the acceptance of 
      the products or the intensity of emotions. The use of brown sugar decreased 
      acceptance (taste, texture, and overall impression) and the intensity of the 
      emotions "active," "loving," "energetic," "healthy," and "refreshing." The use of 
      coconut sugar decreased acceptance (appearance, aroma, and taste) and the intensity 
      of the emotions "refreshing" and "upset." The use of honey improved acceptance in 
      appearance and aroma but reduced the intensity of the emotions "active," "loving," 
      "energetic," and "healthy." Based on sensory data, it is recommended to use demerara 
      sugar or fructose as a substitute for sucrose. In conclusion, the study of emotions 
      can be used as an additional tool for obtaining data related to the sensory 
      acceptance of products.

TI  - Development of arrowroot flour fermented by kefir grains.
PG  - 3722-3730
LID - 10.1111/1750-3841.15472 [doi]
AB  - The present study aims to produce arrowroot flour fermented by kefir grains, in 
      addition to assessing the physicochemical, nutritional, and microbiological 
      characteristics. Fermented arrowroot flour was produced at room temperature 
      (approximately 25 to 28 °C). Fermentation was conducted in batch (6 kg of the 
      substrate and 10% of kefir grains were added with homogenization every 3 hr). 
      Samples were evaluated every 12 hr for both fermentation processes (fermentation 
      process 1: 24 hr and fermentation process 2: 48 hr). The flours were evaluated for 
      physicochemical, nutritional, and microbiological qualities, using a completely 
      randomized design, considering only the variation in the duration of both 
      fermentation processes (from 24 to 48 hr). The fermentation process positively 
      modified the physicochemical, nutritional, and microbial characteristics of the 
      flours. An increase in antioxidant activity (IC(50) : control flour [CF] = 18.9 ± 
      0.13; arrowroot kefir flour [24 hr of fermentation; AKF1] = 15.36 ± 0.14; and 
      arrowroot kefir flour [48 hr of fermentation; AKF2] = 13.84 ± 0.15), protein 
      percentage (CF = 3.08 ± 0.12; AKF1 = 4.87 ± 0.33; and AKF2 = 6.00 ± 0.07), and 
      organic acid (lactic, acetic, and propionic acids) production was observed, as well 
      as modification in color (browning), the conformation of starch structures, and 
      carbohydrate reduction. These results suggested that the "arrowroot kefir flours" 
      open a new perspective for introduction in the market as a new product that can be 
      used as food in nature or food ingredient for making bread, biscuits, pasta, and 
      others, showing microbiological safety and functions properties. PRACTICAL 
      APPLICATION: The fermented flours present improved nutritional characteristics due 
      to the fermentation process, such as higher antioxidant activity and protein levels. 
      Regarding the population growth and societal demand for healthier food, one 
      possibility is to provide a fermented flour with added nutritional value and raise 
      knowledge about the arrowroot. Thus, these flours can be used in various food items 
      or as an ingredient in food preparations for consumers that desire a healthy diet.

AB  - Spray drying was applied for the production of kefir powder. The survival of 
      microorganisms after drying, storage and simulated gastrointestinal (GI) conditions 
      was investigated. Kefir was obtained by fermentation of milk and whey permeate, and 
      was dehydrated directly (traditional kefir) or using different carriers (skim milk, 
      whey permeate and maltodextrin). Low survival (5.5 log and <2 log CFU/g for lactic 
      acid bacteria and yeast respectively) of microorganisms was achieved when kefir was 
      dehydrated without thermoprotectants (carriers). In contrast, survival of the 
      microorganisms was significantly improved in the presence of different carriers. 
      When skim milk (SM) was used as the carrier medium, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) 
      survival was above 9 log CFU/g. In contrast, viability of yeast was dramatically 
      reduced after spray drying in these conditions. When whey permeate was used as the 
      carrier medium, LAB survival was 8 log CFU/g and yeast survival was above 4 log 
      CFU/g. LAB in the kefir powder survived better the simulated GI conditions when 
      spray drying was conducted in SM. LAB in kefir powder sample dehydrated in SM and SM 
      plus maltodextrin remained stable for at least 60 days at 4 °C. Our results 
      demonstrated that spray drying of kefir is a suitable approach to obtain a 
      concentrated kefir-derived product.

TI  - Surface dynamics, fractal features, and micromorphology analysis of kefir biofilms.
LID - 10.1002/jemt.24059 [doi]
AB  - We introduce a study of image analysis of kefir biofilms associated with Acai 
      extract prepared by fermentation of fresh kefir grains natural. Atomic force 
      microscopy data were studied, aiming to understand how the concentration of acai 
      berry (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) influences the surface morphology as well as the 
      texture complexity, evaluated by the fractal dimension. The results showed that the 
      superficial morphology was affected by the increase of Acai concentration in the 
      biofilms, as well as the fractal dimension. It has also been observed that the 
      surface of the biofilm presented saturation when concentration changes from 40 to 
      60 ml. On the other hand, it was observed that the intermediate sample produced with 
      20 ml of acai berry seems to be the best point for biofilms production that can 
      serve as a skin dressing since other studies related to mechanical properties and in 
      vitro and in vivo tests can confirm this applicability. Thus, the characterization 
      of the surface morphology of kefir biofilms by the evaluation of surface statistical 
      parameters and fractal geometry may provide promising results regarding the 
      applicability of these films.

AB  - Water kefir is a beverage which is produced by initiating fermentation of a fruit 
      extract/sucrose solution with insoluble kefir grains. Exopolysaccharides that are 
      formed from sucrose play a major role in the kefir grain formation, but the 
      exopolysaccharides in the kefir beverage and the detailed structural composition of 
      the whole kefir grains have not been studied yet. Therefore, kefir grains and the 
      corresponding kefir beverage were analyzed for exopolysaccharides by multiple 
      chromatographic approaches and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, 
      different fractionation techniques were applied to obtain further information about 
      the exopolysaccharides. The exopolysaccharide-fraction of the investigated kefir 
      beverage was predominantly composed of O3- and O2-branched dextrans as well as lower 
      amounts of levans. The insoluble dextrans from the kefir grains were mostly 
      O3-branched and contained an elevated portion of 1,3-linked glucose units compared 
      to the soluble dextrans. The structurally different exopolysaccharides in water 
      kefir suggest the involvement of multiple bacteria.

TI  - Kefir Accelerates Burn Wound Healing Through Inducing Fibroblast Cell Migration In

AB  - Kefir is a natural probiotic compound with a long history of health benefits which 
      can improve wound healing. This study investigated the regeneration potential of 
      kefir in vitro scratch assay and in vivo burn wound in rat model. Cytotoxicity of 
      different concentrations of kefir was evaluated by colorimetric 
      methylthiazoltetrazolium assay. A scratch wound experiment was performed to 
      investigate the ability of kefir in reducing the gap of wounds in a dose-dependent 
      manner, in vitro. The standardized kefir was incorporated into silver sulfadiazine 
      (SSD) and applied on burn wounds in vivo, and was compared with the SSD and negative 
      control groups after 7, 14, and 28 days of treatment. The wound sites were then 
      removed for histopathological and morphometric analyses, assessment of 
      interleukin-1β (IL-1β), transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), basic fibroblast 
      growth factor (bFGF), dry weight, and hydroxyproline contents. Kefir enhanced 
      proliferation and migration of human dermal fibroblast (HDF) cells and 12.50, 6.25, 
      and 3.12 μL/mL concentrations showed better effects on the scratch assay. Kefir 
      resulted in reduction of IL-1β and TGF-β1 expression at day 7 compared to the 
      negative control. Kefir also reduced the expression of IL-1β at days 14 and 28 and 
      stimulated bFGF at day 28. It significantly improved the dry matter and 
      hydroxyproline contents in the burn wounds. Kefir also resulted in enhanced 
      angiogenesis and elevated migration and proliferation of fibroblasts and improved 
      fibrous connective tissue formation in the wound area. The morphometric results 
      indicated significant global contraction values in the kefir-treated wounds compared 
      to other groups. Taken together, the findings suggest that kefir has considerable 
      ability to accelerate healing of the burn wounds. Therefore, kefir may be a possible 
      option to improve the outcomes of severe burns.

AB  - Excessive body fat accumulation can result in obesity, which is a serious health 
      concern. Kefir, a probiotic, has recently shown possible health benefits in fighting 
      obesity. This study investigated the inhibitory effects of 0.1 and 0.2% kefir powder 
      on fat accumulation in adipose and liver tissues of high-fat diet (HFD)-induced 
      obese mice. Kefir reduced body weight and epididymal fat pad weight and decreased 
      adipocyte diameters in HFD-induced obese mice. This was supported by decreased 
      expression of genes related to adipogenesis and lipogenesis as well as reduced 
      proinflammatory marker levels in epididymal fat. Along with reduced hepatic 
      triacylglycerol concentrations and serum alanine transaminase and aspartate 
      transaminase activities, genes related to lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation were 
      downregulated and upregulated, respectively, in liver tissue. Kefir also decreased 
      serum triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol 
      concentrations. Overall, kefir has the potential to prevent obesity.

TI  - Study of kefir drinks produced by backslopping method using kefir grains from Bosnia 
      and Herzegovina: Microbial dynamics and volatilome profile.

AB  - Kefir is a well-known health-promoting beverage that can be produced by using kefir 
      grains (traditional method) or by using natural starter cultures from kefir 
      (backslopping method). The aim of this study was to elucidate the microbial dynamics 
      and volatilome profile occurring during kefir production through traditional and 
      backslopping methods by using five kefir grains that were collected in Bosnia and 
      Herzegovina. The results from conventional pour plating techniques and 
      amplicon-based sequencing were combined. The kefir drinks have also been 
      characterized in terms of their physico-chemical and colorimetric parameters. A 
      bacterial shift from Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens to Acetobacter syzygii, 
      Lactococcus lactis and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides from kefir grains in 
      traditional kefir to backslopped kefir was generally observed. Despite some 
      differences within samples, the dominant mycobiota of backslopped kefir samples 
      remained quite similar to that of the kefir grain samples. However, unlike the 
      lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria, the yeast counts decreased progressively from 
      the grains to the backslopped kefir. The backslopped kefir samples showed higher 
      protein, lactose and ash content and lower ethanol content compared to traditional 
      kefir samples, coupled with optimal pH values that contribute to a pleasant sensory 
      profile. Concerning the volatilome, backslopped kefir samples were correlated with 
      cheesy, buttery, floral and fermented odors, whereas the traditional kefir samples 
      were correlated with alcoholic, fruity, fatty and acid odors. Overall, the data 
      obtained in the present study provided evidence that different kefir production 
      methods (traditional vs backslopping) affect the quality characteristics of the 
      final product. Hence, the functional traits of backslopped kefir should be further 
      investigated in order to verify the suitability of a potential scale-up methodology 
      for backslopping.

AB  - Excess intake of fructose may contribute to the high prevalence of metabolic 
      disorder. In this study, we investigated the effects of kefir supplementation on the 
      intestine-liver-adipose tissue axis in metabolic disorder induced by high-fructose 
      diet in rats to describe mechanistic action and potential therapeutic value of 
      kefir. Fructose was given to the rats as a 20% solution in drinking water for 
      15 weeks. Kefir was administrated by gastric gavage once a day during the final six 
      weeks. Kefir supplementation improved metabolic parameters, including plasma 
      triglyceride and insulin levels; hepatic weight, triglyceride content and fatty 
      degeneration; omental fat mass in fructose-fed rats. Kefir supplementation decreased 
      the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes in feces, as well as necrotic degeneration, 
      expression levels of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), and inducible nitric oxide 
      synthase (iNOS), but increased expression of tight-junction proteins occludin and 
      claudin-1, in the ileum of the fructose-fed rats. Kefir treatment also reduced the 
      mRNA levels of key lipogenic genes sterol regulatory element-binding protein 
      (SREBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) together with a decline in expression of 
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), NF-κB, and glycosylated glycoprotein (CD68) in 
      the liver. Moreover, kefir treatment improved insulin signaling at the level of 
      insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and phospho-endothelial nitric oxide synthase 
      (peNOS) as well as fructose transporters (GLUT2 and GLUT5) in the liver, but not in 
      the adipose tissue, of high-fructose-fed rats. Consequently, kefir supplementation 
      suppresses hepatic lipogenesis and inflammatory status, but promotes insulin 
      signaling, in association with a change of the fecal microbiota and attenuation of 
      the intestinal permeability factors in high-fructose-fed rats. Thus, we propose that 
      kefir has favorable effects on the hepatic and intestinal irregularities induced by 
      fructose overconsumption.

AB  - Microbial diversity in kefir grains is responsible for the production of goat milk 
      kefir with unique peptides composition and volatile profile. High-throughput 
      sequencing technique was used to analyze bacterial and fungal diversity of three 
      different kefir grains which were originated from China, Europe Germany and United 
      States. Peptides and volatile profile in goat milk kefir were determined by 
      proteomic platform and Gas Chromatography-Ion Mobility Spectrometry, respectively. 
      Clustering analysis indicated that the different content of Lactobacillus genera in 
      different kefir grains was highly associated with the proteolytic ability in goat 
      milk kefir. Contents of volatile compounds in goat milk kefir were also correlated 
      to the bacteria and fungi in kefir grains (especially for Lactobacillus spp. and 
      Saccharomyces spp.). The innovation of this study was to find a new way in 
      exploration of the correlation of microbiota in kefir grains with the proteolytic 
      ability and volatile profile of goat milk kefir.

TI  - Ameliorative effect of kefir against γ-irradiation induced liver injury in male 
      rats: impact on oxidative stress and inflammation.
PG  - 35161-35173

AB  - Ionizing radiation is a double-edged sword because of its benefits and risks to 
      human health. Therefore, protecting human organs from harmful effects of radiation 
      is an important concern of researchers. Kefir, as a good source of probiotics, 
      received growing interest in protective medicine owing to its antioxidant, 
      anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties. Thus, this study was planned to 
      investigate the protective role of kefir against γ-radiation-induced hepatotoxicity. 
      Thirty-two male rats were distributed in four groups: (I) control, (II) received 
      Kefir orally (5 ml/kg body weight) for 28 days, (III) exposed to whole body 
      γ-irradiation (6.5 Gy) to induce hepatotoxicity, and (IV) was pretreated with kefir 
      for 21 days then exposed to γ-irradiation followed by 7 days of kefir treatment. At 
      the end of the experiment, complete blood picture (CBC), liver function, and lipid 
      profile were estimated. Furthermore, levels of lipid peroxidation, nitric oxide 
      content, and endogenous antioxidants, in addition to concentrations of copper, iron, 
      and calcium were measured in liver tissue. Furthermore, monocyte chemoattractant 
      protein-1 (MCP-1) and relative gene expression of nuclear factor kappa (NF-κB) were 
      assessed. The results revealed that oral administration of kefir significantly 
      reduced the radiation-induced hepatic histological alterations, hepatic function 
      impairment, and dyslipidemia. Moreover, kefir notably ameliorated the state of 
      oxidative stress and appeared to inhibit the induced inflammation. This study 
      provides a possible counteracting role of kefir against hepatotoxicity induced 
      γ-radiation. This can focus the benefit of kefir application as a prophylactic 
      treatment to limit hepatic inflammation during radiotherapy.

TI  - KFP-1, a Novel Calcium-Binding Peptide Isolated from Kefir, Promotes Calcium Influx 
      Through TRPV6 Channels.
PG  - e2100182
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.202100182 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Kefir is an acidic and alcoholic fermented milk product with multiple 
      health-promoting benefits. A previous study demonstrated that kefir enhanced calcium 
      absorption in intestinal Caco-2 cells. In this study, kefir-fermented peptide-1 
      (KFP-1) is isolated from the kefir peptide fraction, and its function as a 
      calcium-binding peptide is characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS: KFP-1 was identified 
      as a 17-residue peptide with a sequence identical to that of κ-casein (residues 
      138-154) in milk protein. KFP-1 is demonstrated to promote calcium influx in Caco-2 
      and IEC-6 small intestinal cells in a concentration-dependent manner. TRPV6, but not 
      L-type voltage-gated calcium channels, is associated with the calcium influx induced 
      by KFP-1. An in vitro calcium binding assay indicates that the full-length KFP-1 
      peptide has a higher calcium-binding capacity than the two truncated KFP-1 peptides, 
      KFP-1∆C5 and KFP-1C5. Alexa Fluor 594 labeling shows that KFP-1 is taken up by 
      Caco-2 cells and interacts with calcium ions and TRPV6 protein. Moreover, KFP-1 is 
      found moderately resistant to pepsin and pancreatin digestions and enhanced calcium 
      uptake by intestinal enterocytes in vivo. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that KFP-1, 
      a novel calcium-binding peptide, binds extracellular calcium ions and enters Caco-2 
      and IEC-6 cells, and promotes calcium uptake through TRPV6 calcium channels. The 
      present study is of great importance for developing kefir-derived metal ion-binding 
      peptides as functional nutraceutical additives.

AB  - The aim of this research was to determine how coadministration of ascorbic acid 
      prior to the beginning of X-irradiation influences the lymphocyte DNA damage and 
      also if the kefir supplementation to irradiated mice may alter the recovery 
      procedure of lymphocyte genetic material injury. Following treatment of animals with 
      these agents, the whole-body of mice were irradiated to 6 MV X-rays, then 
      genotoxicity activity was investigated by comet assay. Our results show that the 
      Total Comet Score (TCS) value was 1.39 and 1.5 fold less in the kefir and ascorbic 
      acid groups respectively the following irradiation than in the irradiated mice only. 
      Coadministration of ascorbic acid and kefir with 2 h, before relatively to 2 Gy 
      radiation decreased DNA damage in lymphocyte blood cells. The antioxidant strength 
      of ascorbic acid and kefir were investigated by the study of the 
      1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging properties and also ferric 
      reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. Our results revealed that ascorbic acid and 
      kefir show strong antioxidant activity by these methods. According to these results, 
      it seems that ascorbic acid and kefir, as a free radical scavenging capacitiy, 
      protect animal lymphocyte blood cells from radiation-induced DNA injury and 
      genotoxicity.

TI  - Investigation of microorganisms involved in kefir biofilm formation.
PG  - 2361-2370
LID - 10.1007/s10482-018-1125-6 [doi]
AB  - Kefir is a natural fermentation agent composed of various microorganisms. To address 
      the mechanism of kefir grain formation, we investigated the microbial role in 
      forming kefir biofilms. The results showed that a biofilm could be formed in 
      kefir-fermented milk and the biofilm forming ability reached the maximum at 13 days. 
      The strains Kluyveromyces marxianus, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 
      Lactobacillus kefiri, Lactobacillus sunkii and Acetobacter orientalis were isolated 
      from kefir biofilms by the streak-plate method. These microorganisms were analysed 
      with respect to biofilm forming properties, including their surface characterisation 
      (hydrophobicity and zeta potentials) and the microbial aggregation. The results 
      indicated that Klu. marxianus possessed the strongest biofilm forming properties 
      with the strongest hydrophobicity, lowest zeta potential and greatest 
      auto-aggregation ability. When Klu. marxianus and Ac. orientalis were co-cultured 
      with kefir LAB strains respectively, it was found that mixing Klu. marxianus with 
      Lb. sunkii produced the highest co-aggregation ability. These results elucidated the 
      mechanism of kefir biofilm formation and the microorganisms involved.

AB  - We performed qualitative and quantitative analysis of surfaces of kefir biofilms 
      loaded with Amazon rainforest fruit extract. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic 
      force microscopy were used to evaluate the micromorphology of the biofilms. The 
      films surface displayed a lower density of microorganisms (∼ 0.061 
      microorganisms/μm(2)) for the lowest concentration of fruit extract, however, a 
      greater density (∼0.220 microorganisms/μm(2)) was observed for the higher 
      concentration. Height stereometric parameters revealed that the biofilms with the 
      highest concentration presented the highest roughness. However, almost all the 
      stereometric parameters related to texture showed no significant difference. 
      Furthermore, the Hurst coefficients of the average power spectrum density were 
      similar for all biofilms. Fractal parameters confirmed that higher concentrations of 
      fruit extract induced a superior topographic irregularity. However, fractal 
      lacunarity does not show any significant difference confirming the similarity of the 
      microtextures. Moreover, fractal succolarity and surface entropy exhibited values 
      that suggested ideal percolation and strong topographic uniformity, respectively, 
      indicating that these films can uniformly adhere to other surfaces. Our results 
      confirm that the stereometric and fractal parameters can be relevant for the surface 
      characterization of microbial films, which can be of great importance to the 
      biomedical field.

TI  - Kefir Peptides Prevent Estrogen Deficiency-Induced Bone Loss and Modulate the 
      Structure of the Gut Microbiota in Ovariectomized Mice.
LID - 10.3390/nu12113432 [doi]

AB  - Osteoporosis is a major skeletal disease associated with estrogen deficiency in 
      postmenopausal women. Kefir-fermented peptides (KPs) are bioactive peptides with 
      health-promoting benefits that are produced from the degradation of dairy milk 
      proteins by the probiotic microflora in kefir grains. This study aimed to evaluate 
      the effects of KPs on osteoporosis prevention and the modulation of the composition 
      of the gut microbiota in ovariectomized (OVX) mice. OVX mice receiving an 8-week 
      oral gavage of 100 mg of KPs and 100 mg of KPs + 10 mg Ca exhibited lower trabecular 
      separation (Tb. Sp), and higher bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular number (Tb. 
      N) and bone volume (BV/TV), than OVX groups receiving Ca alone and untreated mice, 
      and these effects were also reflected in bones with better mechanical properties of 
      strength and fracture toughness. The gut microbiota of the cecal contents was 
      examined by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing. α-Diversity analysis indicated that the 
      gut microbiota of OVX mice was enriched more than that of sham mice, but the 
      diversity was not changed significantly. Treatment with KPs caused increased 
      microbiota richness and diversity in OVX mice compared with those in sham mice. The 
      microbiota composition changed markedly in OVX mice compared with that in sham mice. 
      Following the oral administration of KPs for 8 weeks, the abundances of 
      Alloprevotella, Anaerostipes, Parasutterella, Romboutsia, Ruminococcus_1 and 
      Streptococcus genera were restored to levels close to those in the sham group. 
      However, the correlation of these bacterial populations with bone metabolism needs 
      further investigation. Taken together, KPs prevent menopausal osteoporosis and 
      mildly modulate the structure of the gut microbiota in OVX mice.

AB  - Microbial communities often undergo intricate compositional changes yet also 
      maintain stable coexistence of diverse species. The mechanisms underlying long-term 
      coexistence remain unclear as system-wide studies have been largely limited to 
      engineered communities, ex situ adapted cultures or synthetic assemblies. Here, we 
      show how kefir, a natural milk-fermenting community of prokaryotes (predominantly 
      lactic and acetic acid bacteria) and yeasts (family Saccharomycetaceae), realizes 
      stable coexistence through spatiotemporal orchestration of species and metabolite 
      dynamics. During milk fermentation, kefir grains (a polysaccharide matrix 
      synthesized by kefir microorganisms) grow in mass but remain unchanged in 
      composition. In contrast, the milk is colonized in a sequential manner in which 
      early members open the niche for the followers by making available metabolites such 
      as amino acids and lactate. Through metabolomics, transcriptomics and large-scale 
      mapping of inter-species interactions, we show how microorganisms poorly suited for 
      milk survive in-and even dominate-the community, through metabolic cooperation and 
      uneven partitioning between grain and milk. Overall, our findings reveal how 
      inter-species interactions partitioned in space and time lead to stable coexistence.

      erythroleukemia.

AB  - Acute erythroleukemia is an uncommon subtype of acute myeloid leukemia which has 
      been considered to be a subtype of AML with a worse prognosis. Intensive 
      chemotherapy is the first line of treatment. In recent years, the effect of kefir on 
      some malignancies has been experimented. Kefir is a kind of beverage, which obtained 
      by incubation of kefir grains with raw milk. Kefir grains are a symbiotic complex of 
      different kinds of yeasts and bacteria, especially lactic acid bacteria which gather 
      in a mostly carbohydrate matrix, named kefiran. We investigated the effect of kefir 
      on acute erythroleukemia cell line (KG-1) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      (PBMCs). The cell line and PBMCs were treated with different doses of kefir and milk 
      and incubated for three different times. We used Polymixin B to block the 
      lipopolysaccharide and NaOH (1 mol/l) to neutralize the acidic media. Viability was 
      detected by MTT assay. Apoptosis and necrosis were assessed by annexin-propidium 
      iodide staining. Our results showed that kefir induced apoptosis and necrosis in 
      KG-1 cell line. It was revealed that kefir decreased proliferation in 
      erythroleukemia cell line. We did not observe a remarkable effect of kefir on PBMCs. 
      Our study suggested that kefir may have potential to be an effective treatment for 
      erythroleukemia.

TI  - A Non-yeast Kefir-like Fermented Milk Development with Lactobacillus acidophilus

AB  - The use of yeast assist kefir fermentation, but also can cause food spoilage if 
      uncontrolled. Hence, in this study, the microbial composition of an existing 
      commercial kefir starter was modified to produce a functional starter, where 
      Lactobacillus acidophilus KCNU and Lactobacillus brevis Bmb6 were used to replace 
      yeast in the original starter to produce non-yeast kefir-like fermented milk. The 
      functional starter containing L. acidophilus KCNU and L. brevis Bmb6 demonstrated 
      excellent stability with 10(10) CFU/g of total viable cells throughout the 12 weeks 
      low-temperature storage. The newly developed functional starter also displayed a 
      similar fermentation efficacy as the yeast-containing control starter, by completing 
      the milk fermentation within 12 h, with a comparable total number of viable cells 
      (10(8) CFU/mL) in the final products, as in control. Sensory evaluation revealed 
      that the functional starter-fermented milk highly resembled the flavor of the 
      control kefir, with enhanced sourness. Furthermore, oral administration of 
      functional starter-fermented milk significantly improved the disease activity index 
      score by preventing drastic weight-loss and further deterioration of disease 
      symptoms in DSS-induced mice. Altogether, L. acidophilus KCNU and L. brevis Bmb6 
      have successfully replaced yeast in a commercial starter pack to produce a 
      kefir-like fermented milk beverage with additional health benefits. The outcome of 
      this study provides an insight that the specific role of yeast in the fermentation 
      process could be replaced with suitable probiotic candidates.

AB  - Fungal contamination negatively affects the production of cereal foods such as arepa 
      loaf, an ancient corn bread consumed daily in several countries of Latin-America. 
      Chemical preservatives such as potassium sorbate are applied in order to improve the 
      arepa's shelf life and to reduce the health risks. The use of natural preservatives 
      such as natural fermented products in food commodities is a common demand among the 
      consumers. Kefir is a milk fermented beverage obtained by fermentation of kefir 
      grains. Its antibacterial and probiotic activity has been exhaustively demonstrated. 
      Our objectives were to determine the antifungal effect of kefir fermented milk on 
      Aspergillus flavus AFUNL5 in vitro and to study if the addition of kefir fermented 
      milk to arepas could produce shelf life improvement. We determined the antifungal 
      effect on solid medium of kefir cell-free supernatants (CFS) obtained under 
      different fermentation conditions. Additionally, we compared the antifungal effect 
      of kefir CFS with that obtained with unfermented milk artificially acidified with 
      lactic plus acetic acids (lactic and acetic acids at the same concentration 
      determined in kefir CFS) or with hydrochloric acid. Finally, kefir was added to the 
      corn products either in the loaf recipe (kefir-baked arepas) or sprayed onto the 
      baked-loaf surface (kefir-sprayed arepas). The loaves' resistance to natural and 
      artificial fungal contamination and their organoleptic profiles were studied. The 
      highest fungal inhibition on solid medium was achieved with kefir CFS produced by 
      kefir grains CIDCA AGK1 at 100 g/L, incubated at 30 °C and fermented until pH 3.3. 
      Other CFS obtained from different fermentation conditions achieved less antifungal 
      activity than that mentioned above. However, CFS of milk fermented with kefir 
      grains, until pH 4.5 caused an increase of growth rates. Additionally, CFS produced 
      by kefir grains CIDCA AGK1 at 100 g/L, incubated at 30 °C and fermented until pH 3.3 
      achieved higher antifungal activity than CFS from artificially acidified milk with 
      organic acids (CFS L + A) at the same concentration of kefir CFS. Besides, CFS from 
      milk acidified with hydrochloric acid (CFS HCl) showed no fungal inhibition. On the 
      other hand, kefir-baked arepas exhibited significant resistance to natural and 
      artificial fungal contamination. Finally, both kefir-baked and kefir-sprayed arepas 
      retained the organoleptic characteristics of the traditional corn product, but with 
      certain tastes imparted by the kefir fermentation. This work constitutes the first 
      study on fungal inhibition by kefir-fermented milk extending to the protection of 
      corn products of mass-consumption and the possible application as a food 
      preservative.

AB  - Processing of Russian olive water kefir (RWK), as a fermented functional drink made 
      with Russian olive juice and water kefir grains with high antioxidant activity, into 
      powder is crucial for improving its stability for the commercialization of this 
      product. For the first time, this study aimed to encapsulate water kefir 
      microorganisms and bioactive compounds in RWK using carrier materials to develop a 
      synbiotic functional powder using spray drying as an encapsulation method. The goal 
      was maximizing antioxidant activity, product yield, and survival rate of water kefir 
      microorganisms in the produced Russian olive water kefir powder. The optimal spray 
      drying conditions were observed to be at an inlet air temperature of 120ºC, 35 % 
      feed flow rate, and 7 % concentration of drying aid. The effects of spray drying 
      conditions on the quality of microcapsules were assessed and modeled, and the 
      validity of the model was verified. Also, the spray-dried powder's physicochemical 
      properties were assessed and showed promising microbial and physicochemical 
      characteristics compared with the freeze-dried powder.

AB  - Kefir peptides, generated by kefir grain fermentation of milk proteins, showed 
      positive antioxidant effects, lowered blood pressure and modulated the immune 
      response. In this study, kefir peptide was evaluated regarding their 
      anti-inflammatory effects on particulate matter <4 μm (PM(4.0))-induced lung 
      inflammation in NF-κB-luciferase(+/+) transgenic mice. The lungs of mice under 
      20 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg PM(4.0) treatments, both increased significantly the generation 
      of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines; increased the protein 
      expression levels of p-NF-κB, NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-4 and α-SMA. 
      Thus, we choose the 10 mg/kg of PM(4.0) for animal trials; the mice were assigned to 
      four treatment groups, including control group (saline treatment), PM(4.0) + Mock 
      group (only PM(4.0) administration), PM(4.0) + KL group (PM(4.0) + 150 mg/kg 
      low-dose kefir peptide) and PM(4.0) + KH group (PM(4.0) + 500 mg/kg high-dose kefir 
      peptide). Data showed that treatment with both doses of kefir peptides decreased the 
      PM(4.0)-induced inflammatory cell infiltration and the expression of the 
      inflammatory mediators IL-lβ, IL-4 and TNF-α in lung tissue by inactivating NF-κB 
      signaling. The oral administrations of kefir peptides decrease the PM(4.0)-induced 
      lung inflammation process through the inhibition of NF-κB pathway in transgenic 
      luciferase mice, proposing a new clinical application to particulate matter air 
      pollution-induced pulmonary inflammation.

AB  - A new and efficient reversed-phase high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry method was 
      developed for the simultaneous separation and determination of SeO(3) (2-) and 
      seleno-dl-methionine in kefir grains. For the system, limits of detection and 
      quantitation values for SeO(3) (2-) and seleno-dl-methionine were calculated as 
      0.52/1.73 mg/kg (as Se) and 0.26/0.87 mg/kg (as Se), respectively. After performing 
      the system analytical performance, recovery experiment was done for kefir grains and 
      percent recovery results for SeO(3) (2-) and seleno-dl-methionine were calculated as 
      98.4 ± 0.8% and 93.6 ± 1.0%, respectively. It followed by the feeding studies that 
      the kefir grains were exposed to three different concentrations of SeO(3) (2-) (20, 
      30, and 50 mg/kg) for approximately 4 days at room temperature to investigate the 
      conversion/non-conversion of SeO(3) (2-) to seleno-dl-methionine. Next, the fed 
      grains were extracted with tetramethylammonium hydroxide pentahydrate solution (20%, 
      w/w) and then sent to the developed system. There was no detectable 
      seleno-dl-methionine found in fed kefir grains at different concentrations of SeO(3) 
      (2-) while inorganic or elemental selenium in the fed kefir grains was determined 
      between 1579.5 - 3116.0 mg/kg (as Se). Selenium species in the kefir grains samples 
      was found in the form of SeO(3) (2-) proved by using an anion exchange column.

      tapping mode, on square areas of 30 μm × 30 μm. Images were studied by the 
      MountainsMap premium commercial software. The main parameter of the surface, 
      roughness, grew with the increase of the extract concentration up to 0.50 g/L. In 
      addition, asymmetry and kurtosis showed that the biofilm with the best peak 
      distribution was the one with 0.25 g/L of plant extract. The other parameters 
      followed the main results for the surface and were observed for the depth and volume 
      parameters. The power spectrum density spectrum confirmed the reliability of the 
      results for the sample with 0.25 g/L. Therefore, the sample with 0.25 g/L of plant 
      extract produced the best balance in relation to the surface properties. These 
      results showed that the biofilm morphology and microtexture were affected by the 
      incorporation of the plant extract and can be useful to define possible 
      applications.

TI  - Administration of kefir-fermented milk protects mice against Giardia intestinalis 
      infection.
PG  - 1815-1822
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.068064-0 [doi]
AB  - Giardiasis, caused by the protozoan Giardia intestinalis, is one of the most common 
      intestinal diseases worldwide and constitutes an important problem for the public 
      health systems of various countries. Kefir is a probiotic drink obtained by 
      fermenting milk with 'kefir grains', which consist mainly of bacteria and yeasts 
      that coexist in a complex symbiotic association. In this work, we studied the 
      ability of kefir to protect mice from G. intestinalis infection, and characterized 
      the host immune response to this probiotic in the context of the intestinal 
      infection. Six- to 8-week-old C75BL/6 mice were separated into four groups: 
      controls, kefir mice (receiving 1 : 100 dilution of kefir in drinking water for 14 
      days), Giardia mice (infected orally with 4×10(7) trophozoites of G. intestinalis at 
      day 7) and Giardia-kefir mice (kefir-treated G. intestinalis-infected mice), and 
      killed at 2 or 7 days post-infection. Kefir administration was able to significantly 
      reduce the intensity of Giardia infection at 7 days post-infection. An increase in 
      the percentage of CD4(+) T cells at 2 days post-infection was observed in the 
      Peyer's patches (PP) of mice belonging to the Giardia group compared with the 
      control and kefir groups, while the percentage of CD4(+) T cells in PP in the 
      Giardia-kefir group was similar to that of controls. At 2 days post-infection, a 
      reduction in the percentage of B220-positive major histocompatibility complex class 
      II medium cells in PP was observed in infected mice compared with the other groups. 
      At 7 days post-infection, Giardia-infected mice showed a reduction in RcFcε-positive 
      cells compared with the control group, suggesting a downregulation of the 
      inflammatory response. However, the percentages of RcFcε-positive cells did not 
      differ from controls in the kefir and Giardia-kefir groups. An increase in 
      IgA-positive cells was observed in the lamina propria of the kefir group compared 
      with controls at 2 days post-infection. Interestingly, the diminished number of 
      IgA-positive cells registered in the Giardia group at 7 days post-infection was 
      restored by kefir feeding, although the increase in IgA-positive cells was no longer 
      observed in the kefir group at that time. No significant differences in CXCL10 
      expression were registered between groups, in concordance with the absence of 
      inflammation in small-intestinal tissue. Interestingly, a slight reduction in CCL20 
      expression was observed in the Giardia group, suggesting that G. intestinalis might 
      downregulate its expression as a way of evading the inflammatory immune response. On 
      the other hand, a trend towards an increase in TNF-α expression was observed in the 
      kefir group, while the Giardia-kefir group showed a significant increase in TNF-α 
      expression. Moreover, kefir-receiving mice (kefir and Giardia-kefir groups) showed 
      an increase in the expression of IFN-γ, the most relevant Th1 cytokine, at 2 days 
      post-infection. Our results demonstrate that feeding mice with kefir reduces G. 
      intestinalis infection and promotes the activation of different mechanisms of 
      humoral and cellular immunity that are downregulated by parasitic infection, thus 
      contributing to protection.

TI  - Antibiofilm Activity of Kefir Probiotic Lactobacilli Against Uropathogenic 
      Escherichia coli (UPEC).
PG  - 221-229
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inhibition of biofilm formation is essential for the prevention and 
      treatment of urinary tract infection. This study was aimed to identify the probiotic 
      potential of Lactobacillus strains isolated from kefir and evaluate their 
      antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities against Uropathogenic Escherichia coli 
      (UPEC). METHODS: Twelve Lactobacillus strains were evaluated. Antimicrobial and 
      antibiofilm activities of Cell Free Supernatant (CFS) of the Lactobacillus strains 
      against UPEC isolates were evaluated by agar well diffusion method and crystal 
      violet assay, respectively. Probiotic potential of selected isolates was assessed by 
      analyzing their tolerance to acidic pH and bile salts, auto-aggregation ability, 
      co-aggregation with Escherichia coli (E. coli) and hemolytic activity. The isolates 
      were identified by phenotypic and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: The CFS of all 
      lactobacilli strains was able to inhibit UPEC isolates even after neutralization. 
      Four out of 12 isolates inhibited the biofilm formation by UPEC in the range 62-75%. 
      The viability under acidic condition varied among the isolates ranging from 6-89.8%. 
      All the isolates could tolerate the 0.3% bile and eight isolates showed the 
      adaptation time of less than 1 hr. All the strains exhibited co-aggregation with E. 
      coli. Auto-aggregation was highly correlated with co-aggregation of all lactobacilli 
      strains with E. coli (r=0.889, p<0.001). The isolates with satisfactory probiotic 
      potential and higher ability of biofilm inhibition and antibacterial activity 
      belonged to the species Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus paracasei. 
      CONCLUSION: All four selected probiotic strains exhibited antimicrobial and 
      antibiofilm activities, which suggest potential applications for controlling or 
      preventing infections caused by UPEC.

      microbiological aspects and profiling of phosphopeptides by LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS.

AB  - The influence of production technology, namely, temperature, pH and 2-step 
      fermentation (back-slopping approach), on the microbiological characteristics and on 
      the phosphopeptide profile of kefir obtained with kefir grains was investigated. The 
      growth of yeasts, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and acetic acetic bacteria (AAB) in 
      both grains and kefir was affected by the incubation temperature and by the use of 
      back-slopping. In particular, at 25 °C the microbiota of kefir grains was mainly 
      composed by LAB and yeasts, while at 18 °C yeasts represented the dominant group in 
      kefir. Back-slopping at 25 °C determined a significant increase of AAB. A 
      comprehensive characterization of potentially bioactive peptides, including 
      caseino-phosphopeptides (CPPs), was performed, for the first time, in kefir obtained 
      with kefir grains, using preliminary enrichment on hydroxyapatite followed by 
      dephosphorylation and analysis by Liquid Chromatography-ElectroSpray 
      Ionization-Quadrupole-Time of Flight-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS). 
      As a result, seventy-three phosphopeptides, mostly arising from caseins (79% 
      β-casein, 8% α(s1)-casein and 9% α(s2)-casein) and all including from three to five 
      serine residues in their sequences, were identified. Seventy-one of them showed the 
      typical motif "SerP-SerP-SerP-Glu-Glu", which is crucial for the ability of caseins 
      to bind to minerals. Several peptides were observed, for the first time, from the 
      1-40 region of β-casein. As for the effect of production technology, phosphopeptide 
      profiles of kefirs obtained at 25 °C and 18 °C were very similar, whereas kefir 
      produced under acidic conditions showed a predominance of smaller peptides, 
      suggesting a higher level of proteolysis. Conversely, kefir obtained through 
      back-slopping at 25 °C contained longer peptides, thus indicating a lower 
      proteolytic activity and a poor reproducibility in the kefir phosphopeptide profile 
      occurring when grains are reused.

AB  - By combining DGGE-PCR method, classical microbiological analysis and light- and 
      electron microscopic observations, it was found that the composition of microbial 
      communities of central Russia regions kefir grains, starter and kefir drink include 
      bacteria of the genera Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc and Lactococcus, and yeast 
      anamorphs of the genera Saccharomyces, Kazachstania and Gibellulopsis. Fifteen 
      prokaryotic and four eukaryotic pure cultures of microorganisms were isolated and 
      identified from kefir grains. It has been shown that members of the genus 
      Lactobacillus prevailed in kefir grains, whereas strains Leuconostoc 
      pseudomesenteroides and Lactococcus lactis dominated in the final product - kefir 
      drink. Yeasts contained in kefir grains in small amounts have reached a significant 
      number of cells in the process of development of this dairy product. The possibility 
      of reverse cell aggregation has been attempted in a mixed cultivation of all 
      isolated pure cultures, but full formation kefir grains is not yet observed after 
      1.5 years of observation and reinoculations.

      Caucasian regions. In this case, the beneficial effects of a kind of kefir were 
      reported on glycated hemoglobin A (HbA1c) level, and weight loss of an indexed 
      diabetic mellitus patient. The patient as a supplement of her routine anti-diabetic 
      drugs consumed Probiotic kefir. After 90 days of consumption the patient, have about 
      4 kg weight loss, and her HbA1c decreased from 7.9 to 7.1. Depth of sleep and 
      energizing effects of kefir was also from very remarkable findings of this case, as 
      reported by the patient.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the β-glucan contents, physicochemical 
      features, and microbial communities in milk kefir prepared using Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae KU200284 isolated from cucumber jangajji, a fermented vegetable commonly 
      eaten in Korean. Three types of milk kefir were manufactured, with (1) activated 
      kefir grain, (2) activated kefir grain with commercial S. cerevisiae BOF, and (3) 
      activated kefir grain with S. cerevisiae KU200284. β-Glucan contents of milk kefir 
      using kefir grain and kefir grain with S. cerevisiae strains BOF and KU200284 were 
      8.29, 8.59, and 8.57%, respectively. The pH, titratable acidity, viscosity, Brix 
      level, and alcohol contents of milk kefir using kefir grain with S. cerevisiae 
      strains were acceptable compared with milk kefir using only kefir grain. In milk 
      kefir produced using kefir grains and S. cerevisiae strains, 16S rRNA reads showed 
      representative strains of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens (>72% relative abundance) 
      and Acetobacter fabarum (>16% relative abundance). In particular, milk kefir using 
      kefir grain with S. cerevisiae KU200284 had the highest relative abundance of L. 
      kefiranofaciens. In addition, the internal transcribed sequence (ITS) rRNA reads in 
      tested milk kefir showed representative strains of Kluyveromyces marxianus (>52% 
      relative abundance) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (>16% relative abundance). In 
      contrast, milk kefir using S. cerevisiae strains had higher relative abundance of S. 
      cerevisiae (>37%). The β-glucan production, physicochemical properties, and 
      microbial community profiling indicate that S. cerevisiae KU200284 could be used in 
      functional dairy products as a starter culture.

AB  - The aim of the research was to check how the addition of honeydew honey and various 
      compositions of starter cultures affects the water holding capacity, water activity, 
      color, syneresis and consistency of the obtained kefir in the context of its sensory 
      acceptability. In this research, 2.5% and 5% (w/w) honeydew honey was added to the 
      samples of model kefir (K) and commercial kefir (K13). Kefirs differed by the type 
      of used starter cultures and conditions of production. The addition of honeydew 
      honey to kefir resulted in increased water holding capacity and a reduction in water 
      activity. Honeydew honey kefir was characterized by the following flavor: 
      astringent, fruity, pungent and waxy. As the honey content increased, the taste and 
      waxy flavor became sweeter. In the sensory assessment, the attributes of texture and 
      mouthfeel, creaminess, density and firmness, do not change because of the honey 
      amount or storage time of the samples. The use of different starter cultures in 
      kefir production with the addition of honeydew honey impacted texture parameters, 
      resulting in up to a 4.8-fold increased viscosity index.

      Oxygen Impact the Water Kefir Fermentation Process.

AB  - Eleven series of water kefir fermentation processes differing in the presence of 
      oxygen and the type and concentration of inoculum and substrate, were followed as a 
      function of time to quantify the impact of these parameters on the kinetics of this 
      process via a modeling approach. Increasing concentrations of the water kefir grain 
      inoculum increased the water kefir fermentation rate, so that the metabolic activity 
      during water kefir fermentation was mainly associated with the grains. Water kefir 
      liquor could also be used as an alternative means of inoculation, but the resulting 
      fermentation process progressed slower than the one inoculated with water kefir 
      grains, and the production of water kefir grain mass was absent. Substitution of 
      sucrose with glucose and/or fructose reduced the water kefir grain growth, whereby 
      glucose was fermented faster than fructose. Lacticaseibacillus paracasei (formerly 
      known as Lactobacillus paracasei), Lentilactobacillus hilgardii (formerly known as 
      Lactobacillus hilgardii), Liquorilactobacillus nagelii (formerly known as 
      Lactobacillus nagelii), Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Dekkera bruxellensis were the 
      main microorganisms present. Acetic acid bacteria were present in low abundances 
      under anaerobic conditions and only proliferated under aerobic conditions. 
      Visualization of the water kefir grains through scanning electron microscopy 
      revealed that the majority of the microorganisms was attached onto their surface. 
      Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts were predominantly associated with the grains, 
      whereas acetic acid bacteria were predominantly associated with the liquor.

AB  - Kefir is a functional beverage that contains lactic and acetic acid bacteria (LAB, 
      AAB) and yeasts. This work's aim was to study the chemical, microbial, and 
      functional characteristics of kefir produced from cow's milk and soy milk. After 
      fermentation, free amino acids were 20.92 mg 100 mL(-1) and 36.20 mg 100 mL(-1) for 
      cow's milk and soy milk kefir, respectively. Glutamic acid was majority in both, 
      suggesting that microbial proteolysis leads to an increase in free amino acids 
      including glutamic acid. 10(8)-10(9) CFU mL(-1) LAB, 10(6)-10(7) CFU mL(-1) AAB, and 
      10(6)-10(7) CFU mL(-1) yeasts were counted in cow's milk kefir, whereas soy milk 
      kefir contained greatly lower yeasts and AAB. Lactococcus lactis, Kazachstania 
      unispora, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated as major microorganisms in both 
      kefirs. Acetobacter orientalis only existed in cow's milk kefir. Cow's milk and soy 
      milk showed ACE inhibitory activity, which significantly increased after 
      fermentation. Both kefirs also exhibited antioxidant activity and bactericidal 
      activity against Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus 
      aureus.

LID - 12
AB  - In this study, a high-throughput sequencing technique was used to analyze bacterial 
      and fungal diversity of two traditional Tibetan kefir grains from Linzhi (K1) and 
      Naqu (K2) regions. Comparative bioinformatic analyses indicated that Lactobacillus 
      kefiranofaciens, L. kefiri and Kluyveromyces marxianus were the main dominant 
      strains in K1 and K2. In order to research the relationship of the growth of kefir 
      grains, the biofilm and the extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) produced by 
      microorganisms, the proliferation rate of kefir grains, the yield and chemical 
      structure of EPS and the optimal days for biofilm formation were determined. The 
      results showed that the growth rate, the yield of EPS and the biofilm formation 
      ability of K1 were higher than K2, and the optimal day of their biofilm formation 
      was the same in 10th day. Additionally, the live cells, dead cells and EPS in 
      biofilm formation of K1 and K2 were observed by fluorescence microscope to clarify 
      the formation process of kefir grains. To determine the influence of microbial 
      interactions on biofilm and the formation of kefir grains, the essential role of 
      microbial quorum sensing needs further attention.

TI  - High-Throughput, Sequence-Based Analysis of the Microbiota of Greek Kefir Grains 
      from Two Geographic Regions.
PG  - 138-146
LID - 10.17113/ftb.58.02.20.6581 [doi]
AB  - RESEARCH BACKGROUND: Kefir is a natural probiotic drink traditionally produced by 
      milk fermentation using kefir grains. Kefir grains are composed of a complex 
      population of bacteria and yeasts embedded in a polysaccharide-protein matrix. The 
      geographic origin of kefir grains may largely influence their microbial composition 
      and the associated kefir drink properties. Although the detailed bacterial 
      composition of kefir grains from several geographic regions has been reported, to 
      date, analogous data about the microbiome of Greek kefir are lacking. Hence, the aim 
      of this study is to investigate the structure and the diversity of the bacterial 
      community of Greek kefir grains. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The bacterial community 
      structure and diversity of two different kefir grains from distant geographic 
      regions in Greece were examined via high-throughput sequencing analysis, a 
      culture-independent metagenomic approach, targeting the 16S rRNA V4 variable region, 
      in order to gain a deeper understanding of their bacterial population diversities. 
      RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Firmicutes (a phylum that includes lactic acid bacteria) 
      was strikingly dominant amongst the identified bacterial phyla, with over 99% of the 
      sequences from both kefir grains classified to this phylum. At the family level, 
      Lactobacillaceae sequences accounted for more than 98% of the operational taxonomic 
      units (OTUs), followed by Ruminococcaceae, Lahnospiraceae, Bacteroidaceae and other 
      bacterial families of lesser abundance. Α relatively small number of bacterial 
      genera dominated, with Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens being the most abundant in both 
      kefir grains (95.0% of OTUs in kefir A and 96.3% of OTUs in kefir B). However, a 
      quite variable subdominant population was also present in both grains, including 
      bacterial genera that have been previously associated with the gastrointestinal 
      tract of humans and animals, some of which are believed to possess probiotic 
      properties (Faecalibacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Blautia spp.). Differences 
      among the bacterial profiles of the two grains were very small indicating a high 
      homogeneity despite the distant geographic origin. NOVELTY AND SCIENTIFIC 
      CONTRIBUTION: This is the first study to deeply explore and report on the bacterial 
      diversity and species richness of Greek kefir.

TI  - Kefir improves bone mass and microarchitecture in an ovariectomized rat model of 
      postmenopausal osteoporosis.
PG  - 589-99
LID - 10.1007/s00198-014-2908-x [doi]
AB  - SUMMARY: Kefir treatment in ovariectomized (OVX) rats could significantly decrease 
      the levels of bone turnover markers and prevent OVX-induced bone loss, deterioration 
      of trabecular microarchitecture, and biomechanical dysfunction that may be due to 
      increase intracellular calcium uptake through the TRPV6 calcium channel. 
      INTRODUCTION: Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass and 
      structural deterioration of bone tissue, leading to an increased fracture risk. The 
      incidence of osteoporosis increases with age and occurs most frequently in 
      postmenopausal women due to estrogen deficiency, as the balance between bone 
      resorption and bone formation shifts towards increased levels of bone resorption. 
      Among various methods of prevention and treatment for osteoporosis, an increase in 
      calcium intake is the most commonly recommended preventive measure. Kefir is a 
      fermented milk product made with kefir grains that degrade milk proteins into 
      various peptides with health-promoting effects, including immunomodulating-, 
      antithrombotic-, antimicrobial-, and calcium-absorption-enhancing bioactivities. 
      METHODS: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of kefir on osteoporosis 
      prophylaxis in an ovariectomized rat model. A total of 56 16-week-old female 
      Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into 7 experimental groups: sham (normal), 
      OVX/Mock, OVX/1X kefir (164 mg/kg BW/day), OVX/2X kefir (328 mg/kg BW/day), OVX/4X 
      kefir (656 mg/kg BW/day), OVX/ALN (2.5 mg/kg BW/day), and OVX/REBONE (800 mg/kg 
      BW/day). After 12-week treatment with kefir, the bone physiology in the OVX rat 
      model was investigated. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to investigate the 
      possible transport mechanism involved in calcium absorption using the Caco-2 human 
      cell line. RESULTS: A 12-week treatment with kefir on the OVX-induced osteoporosis 
      model reduced the levels of C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (CTx), bone 
      turnover markers, and trabecular separation (Tb. Sp.). Additionally, treatment with 
      kefir increased trabecular bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume (BV/TV), 
      trabecular thickness (Tb. Th), trabecular number (Tb. N), and the biomechanical 
      properties (hardness and modulus) of the distal femur with a dose-dependent 
      efficacy. In addition, in in vitro assay, we found that kefir increased 
      intracellular calcium uptake in Caco-2 cell through TRPV6 calcium channels and not 
      through L-type voltage-operated calcium channels. CONCLUSION: The protective effect 
      of kefir in the OVX rat model may occur through increasing intracellular calcium 
      uptake through the TRPV6 calcium channel.

AB  - Tibetan kefir grains (TKGs) are distinctive and complex mixtures with 
      protein-lipid-polysaccharide matrices and multiple microorganism species. The 
      objective of this study was to evaluate the microflora composition, probiotic 
      species and functional genes within TKGs. Metagenomic analysis was used to evaluate 
      communities of three TKGs, revealing the presence of 715 species, with Lactobacillus 
      kefiranofaciens as the most dominant species. The relative abundances of acetic acid 
      bacteria and yeast significantly differed among the three TKGs (acetic acid 
      bacteria: p < 0.01; yeast: p < 0.05), and the dominant yeast species also varied 
      across three TKGs. Lactobacillus helveticus was the most abundant listed probiotic 
      species, and its abundance did not significantly differ across three TKGs. Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that ko01501 was the most 
      abundant pathway that related to human disease. There are 16 different KOs (KEGG 
      Orthology) in the ko01501 pathway were annotated in TKGs, which helps to resist 
      β-lactam. This study provided a new insight into the microbial community structures 
      and the presence of probiotic species within TKGs and provides a foundation for 
      further targeted studies.

AB  - This work evaluated the effects of long-term kefir treatment in cardiac function 
      (cardiac contractility and calcium-handling proteins) and the central nervous system 
      (CNS) control of the sympathetic signaling in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 
      Male normotensive rats [Wistar Kyoto rats (WKYs)] and SHRs were divided into three 
      groups: WKYs and SHRs treated with vehicle, and SHRs treated with milk fermented by 
      the grains of kefir (5%; SHR-Kefir; oral gavage, 0.3 ml/100 g daily/9 weeks). At the 
      end of treatment, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were measured by 
      direct arterial catheterization. Hemodynamic parameters (left ventricular systolic 
      pressure, left ventricular isovolumetric relaxation time constant, maximal and 
      minimal pressure decay) were acquired through a left ventricular catheter 
      implantation. Left ventricle protein expressions of phospholamban (PLB), its 
      phosphorylated form (p-PLB) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) were 
      determined by Western blot. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) protein expression was 
      evaluated via immunofluorescence within the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the 
      hypothalamus and the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). SHR-Kefir group presented 
      lower MAP and HR compared to SHRs. Kefir treatment ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy 
      and promoted reduced expression of PLB, p-PLB and SERCA2a contractile proteins. 
      Within the PVN and RVML, TH protein overexpression observed in SHRs was reduced by 
      probiotic treatment. In addition, kefir improved cardiac hemodynamic parameters in 
      SHR-treated animals. Altogether, the data show that long-term kefir treatment 
      reduced blood pressure by mechanisms involving reduction of cardiac hypertrophy, 
      improvement of cardiac contractility and calcium-handling proteins, and reduction in 
      the CNS regulation of the sympathetic activity.

AB  - As consumer awareness of food expands, as does the understanding of the correlation 
      between nutrition and health benefits, consumers are increasingly looking for 
      healthier foods. One of these aspects can be observed in the search for foods with 
      clean labels and with the removal/replacement of artificial additives, such as 
      coloring. However, there are still no studies on the perception of foods with a 
      positive reputation, such as fermented dairy. The present work aimed to evaluate the 
      consumers' perception (n = 121) of kefir labels with the addition of food dyes from 
      different origins (KN = natural kefir / no dye; KCA = kefir added with artificial 
      coloring; KCN = kefir added with natural coloring; KCR = kefir added with coloring 
      from fruit residues), associating data obtained through Product Personality Profile 
      (PPP) and the Food Choice Questionnaire (FCQ). Based on FCQ's data, consumers were 
      subdivided into three distinct clusters with specific profiles - Conscious, 
      Balanced, and Flexible - and had their perceptions of each of the kefir labels 
      described by PPP and Multidimensional Alignment Analysis (MDA). By consensus, the 
      groups associated the KN label with individuals concerned about healthy eating and 
      diets, reaffirming the positive commercial positioning of kefir. At the same time, 
      for KCA, a contrasting association was observed. The Conscious group noted the 
      samples better, emphasizing the correlation of KCR (with added fruit residue dye) 
      with an adult female, married and engaged in physical activity. KCN was correlated 
      with a young, single, student and gym or running target group stands out for the 
      Balanced group. The Flexible one also associated the consumption of KCA with a young 
      audience, ranging from athletic to overweight, with a normal to unbalanced diet. In 
      summary, different impacts on the perception of kefir labels could be elicited with 
      the correlation of FCQ, PPP, and MDA, emphasizing the importance of exploring market 
      segments and design strategies for the target audience.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in elderly 
      patients. Recently, several studies have shown that inflammation and oxidative 
      stress precede the cardinal neuropathological manifestations of AD. In view of the 
      proven antioxidant effects of probiotics, we proposed that continuous dietary 
      supplementation with milk fermented with kefir grains might improve cognitive and 
      metabolic and/or cellular disorders in the AD patients. METHODS: This study was 
      designed as an uncontrolled clinical investigation to test the effects of 
      probiotic-fermented milk supplementation (2 mL/kg/daily) for 90 days in AD patients 
      exhibiting cognitive deficit. Cognitive assessment, cytokine expression, systemic 
      oxidative stress levels, and blood cell damage biomarkers were evaluated before (T0) 
      and after (T90) kefir synbiotic supplementation. RESULTS: When the patients were 
      challenged to solve 8 classical tests, the majority exhibit a marked improvement in 
      memory, visual-spatial/abstraction abilities, and executive/language functions. At 
      the end of the treatment, the cytometric analysis showed an absolute/relative 
      decrease in several cytokine markers of inflammation and oxidative stress markers 
      ((·)O(2) (-), H(2)O(2), and ONOO(-), ~30%) accompanied by an increase in NO 
      bioavailability (100%). In agreement with the above findings by using the same 
      technique, we observed in a similar magnitude an improvement of serum protein 
      oxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage/repair, and apoptosis. CONCLUSION: 
      In conclusion, we demonstrated that kefir improves cognitive deficits, which seems 
      to be linked with three important factors of the AD-systemic inflammation, oxidative 
      stress, and blood cell damage-and may be a promising adjuvant therapy against the AD 
      progression.

      Parameters in Adults: a Randomized, Single-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study.

AB  - The dairy products remain as the largest reservoir for isolation of probiotic 
      microorganisms. While probiotics have been immensely reported to exert various 
      health benefits, it is also a common notion that these health potentials are strain 
      and host dependent, leading to the need of more human evidence based on specific 
      strains, health targets, and populations. This randomized, single-blind, and 
      placebo-controlled human study aimed to evaluate the potential benefits of putative 
      probiotic strains isolated from kefir on gastrointestinal parameters in fifty-six 
      healthy adults. The consumption of AB-kefir (Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus 
      acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. helveticus, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, and 
      Streptococcus thermophiles; total 10 log CFU/sachet) daily for 3 week reduced 
      symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating (P = 0.014), and appetite (P = 0.041) in male 
      subjects as compared to the control. Gut microbiota distribution profiles were 
      shifted upon consumption of AB-kefir compared to baseline, where the abundance of 
      bifidobacteria was increased in male subjects and maintained upon cessation of 
      AB-kefir consumption. The consumption of AB-kefir also increased gastrointestinal 
      abundance of total anaerobes (P = 0.038) and total bacterial (P = 0.049) in female 
      subjects compared to the control after 3 weeks. Our results indicated that AB-kefir 
      could potentially be developed as a natural strategy to improve gastrointestinal 
      functions in adults.

AB  - The effects of dairy and dairy-derived products on the human gut microbiota remains 
      understudied. A systematic literature search was conducted using Medline, CINAHL, 
      Embase, Scopus, and PubMed databases with the aim of collating evidence on the 
      intakes of all types of dairy and their effects on the gut microbiota in adults. 
      Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.The search resulted 
      in 6,592 studies, of which eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) met 
      pre-determined eligibility criteria for inclusion, consisting of a total of 468 
      participants. Seven studies assessed the effect of type of dairy (milk, yogurt, and 
      kefir) and dairy derivatives (whey and casein) on the gut microbiota, and one study 
      assessed the effect of the quantity of dairy (high dairy vs low dairy). Three 
      studies showed that dairy types consumed (milk, yogurt, and kefir) increased the 
      abundance of beneficial genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium. One study showed 
      that yogurt reduced the abundance of Bacteroides fragilis, a pathogenic strain. Whey 
      and casein isolates and the quantity of dairy consumed did not prompt changes to the 
      gut microbiota composition. All but one study reported no changes to bacterial 
      diversity in response to dairy interventions and one study reported reduction in 
      bacterial diversity in response to milk intake.In conclusion, the results of this 
      review suggest that dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and kefir may modulate the 
      gut microbiota composition in favor to the host. However, the broader health 
      implications of these findings remain unclear and warrant further studies.

TI  - Immunomodulating capacity of kefir.
PG  - 195-202
AB  - Kefir is a fermented milk produced by the action of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and 
      acetic acid bacteria, trapped in a complex matrix of polysaccharides and proteins. 
      Beyond its inherent high nutritional value as a source of proteins and calcium, 
      kefir has a long tradition of being regarded as good for health in countries where 
      it is a staple in the diet. However, published human or animal feeding trials to 
      substantiate this view are not numerous. The aim of this work was to determine the 
      immunomodulating capacity of kefir on the intestinal mucosal immune response in mice 
      and to demonstrate the importance of dose and cell viability on this response. 
      BALB/c mice were fed with commercial kefir ad libitum (diluted 1/10, 1/50, 1/100 or 
      1/200) or pasteurized kefir (diluted 1/6, 1/10, 1/50, 1/100) for 2, 5 or 7 
      consecutive days. At the end of each feeding period, the bacterial translocation 
      assay was performed in the liver. Small intestine structure was studied by 
      haematoxilin-eosin staining and light microscopy. The number of IgA+ and IgG+ cells 
      was also determined. For the functional doses chosen, cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, 
      IL-10, IL-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) were determined. Kefir and pasteurized kefir 
      were able to modulate the mucosal immune system in a dose-dependent manner. Kefir 
      was administred 10-times more diluted than pasteurized kefir, but it induced an 
      immunomodulation of similar magnitude, indicating the importance of cell viabilty. 
      The results suggest that a Th1 response was controlled by Th2 cytokines induced by 
      kefir feeding. Pasteurized kefir would induce both Th2 and Th1 responses. This is 
      the first study in vivo regarding the mechanisms involved in the immunomodulating 
      capacity of the oral administration of kefir containing viable or heat-inactivated 
      bacteria at different doses.

AB  - Changes in sensorial, chemical and microbiological qualities of kefirs fortified 
      with black carrot (KBCJ), black mulberry (KBMJ), pomegranate (KPJ), and strawberry 
      (KSJ) juices at different concentrations (10, 25 and 50%, w/w) were monitored 
      throughout storage at 4 °C for 12 weeks. The most preferred kefirs by the sensorial 
      panel were KSJ and KPJ, followed by KBMJ and KBCJ. KBMJ was associated with the 
      highest anthocyanin stability, followed by KPJ, KSJ, and KBCJ. Lactic acid 
      [r = (-0.688)-(-0.970)], glucose [r = (-0.563)-(-0.793)] and microorganisms 
      [r = (-0.633)-(-0.961)] in kefirs had significant effect on anthocyanin stability 
      and colour (p < 0.05). Copigmentation between lactic acid and anthocyanins were 
      observed. Fortification with 25% juices led to an increase (1.8-4.8 times) in 
      antioxidant activity (AA). Shelf-lives of samples, except for KPJ, ended after 
      12 weeks of storage, due to low sensorial scores. Additions of SJ, PJ and BMJ at 25% 
      concentration are recommended for the production of more palatable kefir with high 
      AA.

TI  - Differences in Immune Response and Biochemical Parameters of Mice Fed by Kefir Milk 
      and Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Isolated from the Kefir Grains.

AB  - The health benefits of kefir consumption have been well-known for hundreds of years. 
      The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of kefir milk and the 
      probiotic strain Lacticaseibacillus paracasei Ž2 isolated from kefir grains on the 
      immune response and selected parameters of the lipid and liver enzymatic profiles of 
      mice. Mice fed with kefir milk showed significantly increased phagocytic activity 
      and percentages of B cells in the blood and increased gene expression for mucins and 
      percentages of CD8+ lymphocytes in the gut. By applying kefir, we achieved a 
      significant reduction in serum LDL cholesterol and an LDL/HDL ratio that favored an 
      increase in HDL cholesterol. Regarding the hepatic enzymes, in particular a 
      significant reduction in ALT activity was observed. L. paracasei Ž2 alone stimulated 
      the immune response more markedly compared with kefir milk. Regarding the systemic 
      level, we observed increases in the proportion of all T cells (CD3(+)), CD4(+) 
      lymphocytes and the ratio of CD4+:CD8+ cells, and regarding the local intestinal 
      level we noted a significant increase in gene expression for mucins (MUC-1 and 
      MUC-2) and IgA. Moreover, we confirmed the formation of a biofilm on the surface of 
      the forestomach only after the application of L. paracasei Ž2 alone, but not after 
      kefir administration. The results confirmed the hypothesis that the final effect of 
      the probiotic does not correspond with the effect of the individual strain but is 
      the result of mutual interactions of the microorganisms presented in a preparation, 
      and therefore in the case of multi-strain probiotics, in vivo testing of the complex 
      preparation is necessary.

PG  - 1562-1570
LID - 10.1099/ijsem.0.003936 [doi]
AB  - Two Bifidobacterium strains, TMW 2.2057(T) and TMW 2.1764 were isolated from two 
      different homemade water kefirs from Germany. Both strains were oxidase- and 
      catalase-negative and Gram-staining-positive. Cells were non-motile, irregular rods 
      that were aerotolerant anaerobes. On basis of fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase 
      activity, they were assigned to the family Bifidobacteriaceae. Comparative analysis 
      of 16S rRNA and concatenated housekeeping genes (clpC, dnaB, dnaG, dnaJ, hsp60 and 
      rpoB) demonstrated that both strains represented a member of the genus 
      Bifidobacterium, with Bifidobacterium subtile DSM 20096(T) as the closest 
      phylogenetic relative (98.35 % identity). Both strains can be distinguished using 
      randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting. Analysis of concatenated marker 
      gene sequences as well as average nucleotide identity by blast (ANIb) and ﻿in silico 
      DNA﻿-DNA hybridization (isDDH) calculations of their genome sequences confirmed 
      Bifidobacterium subtile DSM 20096(T) as the closest relative (87.91 and 35.80 % 
      respectively). All phylogenetic analyses allow differentiation of strains TMW 
      2.2057(T) and TMW 2.1764 from all hitherto described species of the genus 
      Bifidobacterium with validly published names. We therefore propose a novel species 
      with the name Bifidobacterium tibiigranuli, for which TMW 2.2057(T) (=DSM 
      108414(T)=LMG 31086(T)) is the type strain.

AB  - Kefir grains are a unique symbiotic association of different microbiota, including a 
      variety of bacterial and fungal species. The microbiota in kefir grains is strongly 
      influenced by the geographical origin and sub-culturing environment. After 
      sub-culturing in goat milk for 2 to 4 months, amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA and ITS1 
      region) was applied for the identification of bacterial and fungal autogenic 
      succession of three kefir grains collected from China (CN, Asia), Germany (DE, 
      Europe) and United States of America (USA, America). Taxonomic analysis displayed 
      three main bacterial and fungal species in kefir grains from different origins 
      during sub-culturing process (Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus 
      kefiranofaciens and Lactobacillus kefiri for bacteria, Kazachstania unispora, 
      Kluyveromyces marxianus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae for fungi). Based on the 
      results of beta diversity analysis, microbiota in kefir grains from CN and DE would 
      be stable when sub-cultured in goat milk for more than three months. Differently, a 
      highly microbial stability has been found for the sample from USA during the whole 
      sub-culturing process. These results helped to understand the composition and 
      stability of microbiota in kefir grains when sub-cultured in goat milk.

TI  - Structural evaluation of polymeric microbial films grown on kefir loaded with 
      Maytenus rigida extract.
PG  - 627-638
LID - 10.1002/jemt.23621 [doi]
AB  - Kefir is a probiotic that has several health promising properties. Its grains can 
      form microbial films on different types of substrates. In the present work, the 
      surface characteristics of kefir biofilms associated with Maytenus rigida Mart. 
      extract were minutely studied. Three different concentrations of plant extract were 
      included in the biofilm forming solutions, where fresh grains of kefir were 
      inoculated. The results showed that the plant extract was successfully incorporated 
      into the exopolysaccharide matrix of the biofilm. The main chemical components found 
      linked to the plant extract were triterpenes. The crystallinity of biofilms 
      increased with the addition of the plant extract. The morphology revealed that at 
      low concentrations of the extract there was a prevalence of lactobacilli, while at 
      high concentrations yeasts were more observed. Adhesion and wettability were higher 
      for biofilm with less extract. These results revealed that a combination of plant 
      extract and kefir's exopolysaccharide could form biofilms with chemical and 
      topographic properties of great interest in regenerative medicine.

TI  - Use of ultrafiltrated cow's whey for the production of whey cheese with Kefir or 
      probiotics.
PG  - 555-563
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.10667 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Southern European countries, whey cheeses are normally produced with 
      ovine or caprine whey. Cow's cheese whey can also be used, although the whey cheese 
      yield is low (2-3%, w/v) which discourages its use. In the present study, bovine 
      cheese whey was concentrated by ultrafiltration for the production of four types of 
      whey cheeses (Requeijão): conventional, without any addition (WC); with 10% (w/w) 
      addition of cream (WCC); with cream fermented with Kefir culture (WCCK); and with 
      cream fermented with Bifidobacterium sp. culture (WCCBB12). RESULTS: Whey cheeses 
      with cream presented lower protein content (330-360 g kg(-1) , dry basis) and higher 
      levels of total solids (220-250 g kg(-1) ) and fat (300-330 g kg(-1) , dry basis) 
      than WC. C16:0 and C18:1 were the most abundant fatty acids present, with 31% and 
      38%, respectively. The small differences found concerning instrumental determination 
      of colour and texture were not perceived by panelists. However, the presence of 
      Kefir and probiotics decreased the elastic modulus (G') of the samples, as well as 
      their viscosity. Fermentation with Kefir presented the highest counts of lactic acid 
      bacteria (7 logUFC g(-1) ). However, after 14 days of refrigerated storage, the 
      counts of yeasts and moulds reached 6 logUFC g(-1) in all products, indicating the 
      need for appropriate packaging solutions. CONCLUSION: Ultrafiltration of bovine whey 
      allows for the efficient production of bovine whey cheeses. The addition of cream 
      fermented with Kefir or BB12 appears to be an efficient methodology to incorporate 
      Kefir or probiotic bacteria in Requeijão, improving its nutritional and sensory 
      characteristics, alongside the potential for the extension of its shelf-life. © 2020

TI  - Effects of kefir on ischemia-reperfusion injury.
PG  - 887-96
LID - 8645 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the effect of kefir on Ischemia-Reperfusion (I/R) 
      injury on rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats between 250-350 g 
      were selected. Rats were divided into three groups, and there were eight rats in 
      each group. Rats were fed for 60 days. All of the rats were fed with the same diet 
      for the first 30 days. In the second thirty days, kefir [10 cc/kg/day body weight (2 
      x 109 cfu/kg/day)] was added to the diet of the study group by gavage method. In all 
      groups, lung and kidney tissues were removed after the procedure and rats were 
      sacrificed. The biochemical and histopathological changes were observed in the lung 
      and kidney within the samples. Serum urea, creatinine and tumor necrosis factor 
      (TNF-α) were determined. RESULTS: Kefir + I/R groups was compared with I/R groups, a 
      significant decrease (p < 0.05) was seen in Lipid peroxidation (MDA) levels of lung 
      and renal tissues. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase (CAT) and Glutathione 
      peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities of lung and kidney tissues decreased in I/R groups (p 
      < 0.05). The enzyme activities in Kefir + I/R groups of renal tissues were 
      significantly (p < 0.05) higher than I/R, not significantly different in lung 
      tissues (p < 0.05). Kefir reduced the levels of serum urea, creatinine and TNF-α 
      significantly. CONCLUSIONS:   This would be useful in this model against 
      ischemia/reperfusion, and shows the protective effect of kefir in tissue and serum 
      functions.

TI  - Masseter muscle and gingival tissue inflammatory response following treatment with 
      high-fructose corn syrup in rats: Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of 
      kefir.
PG  - e13732
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.13732 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate whether high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) intake 
      (20% beverages) impacts antioxidative structures and inflammation in the gingival 
      tissue and masseter muscle of rats. Kefir was tested for its potential utility on 
      changes induced by HFCS. Animals were randomly divided into four groups as control, 
      kefir, HFCS, and HFCS plus kefir. HFCS was given as 20% solutions in drinking water 
      while kefir supplementations were given by gastric gavage for 8 weeks. It has been 
      clearly determined that the HFCS diet increased expressions of interleukin (IL)-6, 
      IL-1β, and tumor necrosis factor-α proinflammatory structures via lymphocyte 
      infiltration by suppressing antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide 
      dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase in both tissues. Kefir improved these 
      undesirable changes in rats fed with HFCS. The results of this current study, the 
      first investigation to examine the effects of kefir on masseter muscle and gingival 
      tissue, may provide new access to the restorative effects of kefir consumption on 
      oral health disorders caused by high fructose in the diet. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: 
      In this study, at an early age, the effects of kefir on improving inflammation via 
      antioxidation in the masseter muscle and gingival tissue were investigated for the 
      first time. We showed that kefir feeding ameliorates lymphocyte infiltration on the 
      high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS)-induced masseter muscle and gingival tissue 
      inflammation in rats. The mRNA expressions of inflammatory parameters measured in 
      the study were supported by protein measurements via ELISA or immunohistochemistry. 
      In the present study, kefir may play an important role in the antioxidation and 
      inflammation process on the masseter muscle and gingival tissue against HFCS.

TI  - Kefir inhibits 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation through down-regulation of 
      adipogenic transcription factor expression.
PG  - 485-90
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.5792 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Kefir, a traditional fermented milk composed of microbial symbionts, is 
      reported to have various health benefits such as anti-tumour, anti-inflammatory, 
      anti-neoplastic and pro-digestive effects. In this study, to elucidate the effects 
      of kefir on adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation, three fractions were 
      prepared from kefir culture broth. The inhibitory effects of kefir liquid culture 
      broth fraction (Fr-1), soluble fraction (Fr-2) and insoluble fraction (Fr-3), 
      prepared by sonication of kefir solid culture broth, on adipocyte differentiation in 
      3T3-L1 preadipocytes were examined. RESULTS: Fr-3 (0.1 mg mL(-1)) significantly 
      decreased lipid accumulation and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) activity 
      by 60 and 68% respectively without affecting cell viability. In addition, Fr-3 
      treatment down-regulated the mRNA expression of adipogenic transcription factors 
      including C/EBPα (32%), PPARγ (46%) and SREBP-1c (34%) during adipocyte 
      differentiation compared with untreated control cells. The mRNA expression of 
      adipocyte-specific genes (aP2, FAS and ACC) was also clearly decreased. CONCLUSION: 
      The results suggest that the insoluble fraction of kefir (Fr-3) mediates 
      anti-adipogenic effects through the inhibition of adipocyte differentiation, partly 
      via suppression of the C/EBPα-, SREBP-1c- and PPARγ-dependent pathways.

TI  - Benefits of multi-day supplementation with probiotic kefir in Rasmussen 
      encephalitis: the first case report.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1080/1028415X.2021.1970299 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rasmussen encephalitis (RE) is a rare inflammatory disease, 
      characterized by unilateral hemispheric atrophy, focal intractable seizures, 
      progressive hemiparesis, and neurological deficits. CASE REPORT: The patient is a 
      young man under pharmacotherapy for epilepsy, exhibiting classical abnormal 
      movements, which are consider typical hallmarks of RE. During clinical care 
      sessions, he presented many episodes of tonic-clonic seizures involving sudden loss 
      of consciousness followed by a post-ictal phase with weakness and interaction 
      difficulty. During the kefir supplementation, the patient presented only short-term 
      absence seizures, quickly returning to activities. Additionally, he presented 
      cognitive and language improvement, being more responsive to commands. The daily 
      diary control of patient's mother and caregiver at school reported an impressive 
      reduction in number and severity of seizures, becoming less aggressive and more 
      involved in school activities. The serum biochemical markers showed that kefir 
      administration caused a significant decrease of pro-inflammatory and a simultaneous 
      increase of anti-inflammatory cytokine levels. In parallel, after treatment, this 
      probiotic reduced reactive oxygen species levels, increased NO bioavailability, 
      revealing antiapoptotic and antigenotoxic effects. Regarding the microbiological 
      analysis, kefir increased Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. CONCLUSION: To 
      our knowledge, this is the first case reporting remarkable beneficial effects of the 
      probiotic kefir in RE. This case report strongly suggests kefir supplementation as a 
      potential and safe-effective adjuvant therapeutic strategy in the control and 
      treatment of RE.

AB  - Kefir grains are complex microbial systems of several groups of microorganisms. The 
      identification and quantification of the microbial composition of milk kefirs was 
      described in several studies, which provided an insight into the microbial consortia 
      in this complex ecosystem. Nevertheless, the current methods for identification and 
      quantification are not appropriate for deeper studies on kefir consortia, e.g., 
      population dynamics and microbial interactions in kefir grains. This requires 
      another sensitive and reliable quantitative method. Therefore, this study aims to 
      develop multiplexed qPCR assays to specifically detect and quantify, as an example, 
      several microorganisms of the milk kefir microbial community. Primer-probe sets, 
      which target species-specific genes in six bacteria and five yeasts, were designed, 
      and their sensitivity and specificity to the target species was analyzed in simplex 
      as well as four multiplex qPCR assays. The self-designed multiplex assays were 
      applied for the detection of target bacteria and yeast species in milk kefirs, in 
      both, grain and beverage fractions. Detection of all target microorganisms in 
      simplex and multiplex qPCR was achieved by good linearity, efficiency, repeatability 
      and reproducibility in all assays. When the designed assays were applied on six 
      kefirs, all target microorganisms were detected in different samples, but not all in 
      one kefir sample. The two ubiquitous lactobacilli Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens and 
      Lb. kefiri were present in all six kefirs studied, but were associated with 
      different other yeasts and bacteria. Especially on the yeast community a significant 
      diversity was observed. In general, multiplex TaqMan qPCR as developed here was 
      proven to have high potential for specific identification of target microorganisms 
      in kefir samples and for the first time, eleven target bacteria and yeasts of kefir 
      microbiota were rapidly detected and quantified. This study, thus, provides a fast 
      and reliable protocol for future studies on kefir and other similar microbial 
      ecosystems.

AB  - Cancer is a major health problem in many parts of the world. Conventional anticancer 
      treatments are painful, expensive, and unsafe. Therefore, demand is increasing for 
      cancer treatments preferentially in the form of functional foods or nutritional 
      supplements. Kefir, a traditional fermented milk dairy product, has significant 
      antimutagenic and antitumor properties. This research addresses the hypothesis that 
      kefir's anticancer properties are affected by fermentation conditions. Initially, 
      kefir extracts prepared under standard conditions were screened against 7 cancer 
      cell lines using the tetrazolium dye 
      3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay. 
      Colon cancer and chronic myelogenous leukemia cells were found to be most 
      susceptible to kefir extracts. Subsequently, a factorial design was implemented to 
      assess the effects of 3 fermentation times (24, 48, and 72 h), 3 kefir-to-milk 
      ratios (2, 5, and 10% wt/vol), and 3 fermentation temperatures (4, 25, and 40°C) on 
      kefir's anticancer properties. Remarkably, exploration of the fermentation 
      conditions allowed the anticancer properties of kefir to be enhanced by 5- to 8-fold 
      against susceptible cell lines. Overall, these results demonstrate the possibility 
      of optimizing the anticancer properties of kefir as a functional food in cancer 
      therapy.

AB  - Polymerized whey protein and low-methoxyl pectin were used as thickening agents in 
      fermented dairy food formulations. Effects of polymerized whey protein and pectin 
      (PP) system on particle size distributions, rheological properties, molecular weight 
      distributions of polysaccharides, microstructures, and volatile compounds of goat 
      milk kefir mild and kefir were investigated. Clustering analysis indicated that the 
      PP system addition could increase the particle size distributions and rheological 
      properties of both kefir products. Molecular weight distributions of polysaccharides 
      shown that an intermolecular aggregation occurred between pectin and 
      exopolysaccharides (produced by microorganisms from starter cultures). Micrographs 
      suggested that polymerized whey protein interacted with casein network to form a 
      dense structure. Meanwhile, PP system did not change the characteristics flavor of 
      goat milk kefir mild and kefir. Results indicated that the PP system may be a good 
      combination to improve the physical properties of kefir products. PRACTICAL 
      APPLICATION: Goat milk kefir has gained more and more attention due to its specific 
      flavor and functional properties. However, poor texture of milk curd limits the 
      consumption of fermented goat milk. As a new combination of thickening agents, PP 
      system could specifically improve the particle size distributions and rheological 
      properties of fermented goat milk. And the characteristic flavor of goat milk kefir 
      was not changed. Results indicated that PP system can be used as thickening agents 
      for formulations of different fermented goat milk products.

AB  - This study was aimed to determine the changes in kefir samples (CK and GK) made from 
      cow's and goat's milk during frozen storage. The CK and GK samples were first stored 
      at +4 °C for 14 and 21 days. Thereafter, all the samples were frozen at -35 °C for 
      24 h and kept at -18 °C for 45 days. There was no significant change in the fat, 
      protein, acidity and pH values in both samples during the storage. The values of 
      viscosity, WI and C* were higher in the CK samples while the syneresis value was 
      higher in the GK samples throughout the frozen storage. The microorganisms 
      (Lactococcus spp., Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc spp., total mesophilic aerobic 
      bacteria and yeasts) found in kefir made from goat's milk were more affected from 
      the frozen storage. In both samples, the changes in organic acids and volatile 
      flavor components were not significant during frozen storage, except acetic, citric 
      and oxalic acids and acetaldehyde in GK sample. In addition, CK samples were 
      preferred sensorially more by the panellists during frozen storage.

AB  - AIM AND OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of probiotic products in reducing the 
      levels of salivary Streptococcus mutans before and after their consumption. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty school children with initial carious lesions in the 
      age group of 8-12 years were selected and divided into four groups. Children in 
      group I (control) were undergone with restorations without supplementation of 
      probiotics. Children in group II (kefir milk), group III (probiotic curd), and group 
      IV (probiotic drink) supplemented 100 mL of their respective probiotics for 1 month. 
      Assessment of saliva sample was done at baseline, 1 hour after administration of 
      probiotics followed by weekly intervals till 1 month. RESULTS: The study showed a 
      marked reduction in colony-forming units (CFUs) at a 1-hour time interval in all 
      four groups when compared to baseline. On the 30th-day, children in group II and 
      group III have shown an equal reduction of CFUs when compared to group IV and group 
      I. CONCLUSION: Probiotic products like kefir milk and probiotic curd have shown an 
      equal and marked decrease in CFUs when compared to the probiotic drink group. 
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The administration of probiotics along with dairy products 
      can be used as an adjuvant to routine preventive treatment procedures in the 
      prevention of dental caries along with the remineralization of the demineralized 
      tooth structure. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Reddy S, Madhu V, Punithavathy R, et al.

AB  - Tibetan kefir grains (TKG) are multi-functional starter cultures used in foods and 
      have been applied in various fermentation systems. This study aimed to investigate 
      the microbial community composition of TKG, the detoxification abilities of TKG and 
      their isolates towards common mycotoxins, and the potential for applying TKG and 
      their associated microbial populations to avoid mycotoxin contamination in dairy 
      products. Cultivation-independent high-throughput sequencing of bacterial and fungal 
      rDNA genes indicated that Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens and Kazachstania turicensis 
      were the most abundant bacterial and fungal taxa, respectively. In addition, 27 
      total isolates were obtained using cultivation methods. TKG removed more than 90% of 
      the Ochratoxin A (OTA) after 24 h, while the isolate Kazachstania unisporus AC-2 
      exhibited the highest removal capacity (~46.1%). Further, the isolate exhibited good 
      resistance to acid and bile salts environment. Analysis of the OTA detoxification 
      mechanism revealed that both adsorption and degradation activities were exhibited by 
      TKG, with adsorption playing a major detoxification role. Furthermore, the addition 
      of OTA did not affect the microbial community structure of TKG. These results 
      indicate that TKG-fermented products can naturally remove mycotoxin contamination of 
      milk and could potentially be practically applied as probiotics in fermentation 
      products.

AB  - Doxorubicin (DOX), a powerful anthracycline antibiotic commonly used to treat a wide 
      variety of cancers, is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species 
      that cause oxidative damage, resulting in cardiac dysfunction. Components of dairy 
      may have protective effects against DOX-induced cardiac damage. Kefir is a naturally 
      fermented milk product containing antioxidants, probiotic bacteria, and yeast in 
      addition to the protective components of dairy. We explored the effects of dietary 
      milk and kefir on DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. We used singly housed, 
      10-wk-old male Sprague Dawley rats assigned to 1 of 3 isocaloric diets, control (CON 
      n = 24), milk (MLK, n = 24), or kefir (KEF, n = 24), with equivalent macronutrient 
      profiles. After a 9-wk dietary intervention, all animals were given either a bolus 
      injection (15 mg/kg) of DOX (CON-DOX n = 12; MLK-DOX n = 12, KEF-DOX n = 12) or 
      saline (CON-SAL n = 12; MLK-SAL n = 12; KEF-SAL n = 12). Body weight, grip strength, 
      echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac geometry, and cardiac function were 
      evaluated using echocardiography at 5 d postinjection and data were analyzed using 
      ANOVA. Survival at d 5 post-DOX injection was 92 and 100% in KEF-DOX and MLK-DOX, 
      respectively, and 75% in CON-DOX. By the last week of the dietary intervention, and 
      just before injection with saline or DOX, CON weighed significantly (14%) more than 
      the MLK and KEF. The DOX treatment resulted in significant reductions in body 
      weight; however, we found no diet × drug interactions. The DOX treatment reduced 
      peak grip strength compared with SAL; when compared with pre-injection measures, 
      MLK-DOX rats did not experience a significant reduction in peak grip strength 
      compared with CON-DOX and SAL-DOX rats. Heart mass in MLK and KEF was significantly 
      higher when compared with CON. In summary, 9 wk of milk or kefir ingestion resulted 
      in lower body size and higher heart mass after DOX treatment. Additionally, MLK 
      preserved peak grip strength after DOX treatment, whereas KEF or CON did not. We 
      observed no consistent protective effects with respect to heart dimensions and 
      function. These findings suggest that long-term milk or kefir ingestion may be 
      helpful in optimizing health before and during doxorubicin treatment.

AB  - Eight water kefir fermentation series differing in the presence of oxygen, the 
      nutrient concentration, and the nutrient source were studied during eight 
      consecutive backslopping steps. The presence of oxygen allowed the proliferation of 
      acetic acid bacteria, resulting in high concentrations of acetic acid, and decreased 
      the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium aquikefiri. Low nutrient concentrations 
      resulted in slow water kefir fermentation and high pH values, which allowed the 
      growth of Comamonas testosteroni/thiooxydans. Further, low nutrient concentrations 
      favored the growth of Lactobacillus hilgardii and Dekkera bruxellensis, whereas high 
      nutrient concentrations favored the growth of Lactobacillus nagelii and 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Dried figs, dried apricots, and raisins resulted in stable 
      water kefir fermentation. Water kefir fermentation with dried apricots resulted in 
      the highest pH and water kefir grain growth, whereas that with raisins resulted in 
      the lowest pH and water kefir grain growth. Further, water kefir fermentation with 
      raisins resembled fermentations with low nutrient concentrations, that with dried 
      apricots resembled fermentations with normal nutrient concentrations, and that with 
      fresh figs or a mixture of yeast extract and peptone resembled fermentations with 
      high nutrient concentrations.

TI  - Kefir induces cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in HTLV-1-negative malignant 
      T-lymphocytes.
PG  - 39-47
LID - 10.2147/CMR.S15109 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Adult lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignancy that occurs in white 
      blood cells. The overall cure rate in children is 85%, whereas it is only 40% in 
      adults. Kefir is an important probiotic that contains many bioactive ingredients, 
      which give it unique health benefits. It has been shown to control several cellular 
      types of cancer. PURPOSE: The present study investigates the effect of a cell-free 
      fraction of kefir on CEM and Jurkat cells, which are human T-lymphotropic virus type 
      I (HTLV-1)-negative malignant T-lymphocytes. METHODS: Cells were incubated with 
      different kefir concentrations. The cytotoxicity of the compound was evaluated by 
      determining the percentage viability of cells. The effect of all the noncytotoxic 
      concentrations of kefir on the proliferation of CEM and Jurkat cells was then 
      assessed. The levels of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α), transforming 
      growth factor- beta1 (TGF-β1), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and MMP-9 mRNA 
      upon kefir treatment were then analyzed using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain 
      reaction (RT-PCR). Finally, the growth inhibitory effects of kefir on cell-cycle 
      progression/apoptosis were assessed by Cell Death Detection (ELISA) and flow 
      cytometry. RESULTS: The maximum cytotoxicity recorded after 48-hours treatment with 
      80 μg/μL kefir was only 42% and 39% in CEM and Jurkat cells, respectively. The 
      percent reduction in proliferation was very significant, and was dose-, and 
      time-dependent. In both cell lines, kefir exhibited its antiproliferative effect by 
      downregulating TGF-α and upregulating TGF-β1 mRNA expression. Upon kefir treatment, 
      a marked increase in cell-cycle distribution was noted in the preG(1) phase of CEM 
      and Jurkat cells, indicating the proapoptotic effect of kefir, which was further 
      confirmed by Cell Death Detection ELISA. However, kefir did not affect the mRNA 
      expression of metalloproteinases needed for the invasion of leukemic cell lines. 
      CONCLUSION: In conclusion, kefir is effective in inhibiting proliferation and 
      inducing apoptosis of HTLV-1-negative malignant T-lymphocytes. Therefore, further in 
      vivo investigation is highly recommended.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the antioxidant potential of goat's milk and whey 
      from goat's milk fermented with selected bacteria strains from kefir grain (L. 
      plantarum, L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus) with regard to fermented 
      cow's milk with the same bacteria strains. The assessment of antioxidant potential 
      was made by ABTS, DPPH, TPC and FRAP methods. The work also assessed metabolic 
      activity of tested lactic acid bacteria using measurement of electrical impedance 
      changes in the growing medium. The highest values describing the antioxidant 
      potential were found for fermented milk by L. acidophilus. It was also found that 
      the time of cooling storage causes significantly increasing the antioxidant 
      potential of most analyzed samples. Metabolic activity of tested lactic acid 
      bacteria was the highest for cow's milk. The course of curves for goat's milk and 
      whey from goat's milk was similar, which confirms the differences between cow and 
      goat milk.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat gaining more and more practical 
      significance every year. The main determinants of AMR are the antimicrobial 
      resistance genes (ARGs). Since bacteria can share genetic components via horizontal 
      gene transfer, even non-pathogenic bacteria may provide ARG to any pathogens which 
      they become physically close to (e.g. in the human gut). In addition, fermented food 
      naturally contains bacteria in high amounts. In this study, we examined the 
      diversity of ARG content in various kefir and yoghurt samples (products, grains, 
      bacterial strains) using a unified metagenomic approach. We found numerous ARGs of 
      commonly used fermenting bacteria. Even with the strictest filter restrictions, we 
      identified ARGs undermining the efficacy of aminocoumarins, aminoglycosides,

      bacterial multiplication. The results presented suggest that the starting culture

AB  - BACKGROUND: Controversy exists as to whether the lipid-lowering properties of kefir 
      drink (a fermented probiotic dairy product) in animal models could be replicated in 
      humans. OBJECTIVE: To assess and compare the potential lipid-lowering effects of 
      kefir drink with low-fat milk in a dairy-rich diet in overweight or obese 
      premenopausal women. METHODS: In this 8-week, single-center, multiarm, 
      parallel-group, outpatient, randomized controlled trial, 75 eligible Iranian women 
      aged 25 to 45 years were randomly allocated to kefir, milk, or control groups. Women 
      in the control group received a weight-maintenance diet containing 2 servings/d of 
      low-fat dairy products, whereas subjects in the milk and kefir groups received a 
      similar diet containing 2 additional servings/d (a total of 4 servings/d) of dairy 
      products from low-fat milk or kefir drink, respectively. At baseline and study end 
      point, serum levels/ratios of total cholesterol (TC), low- and high-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC and HDLC), triglyceride, Non-HDLC, TC/HDLC, LDLC/HDLC, 
      and triglyceride/LDLC were measured as outcome measures. RESULTS: After 8 weeks, 
      subjects in the kefir group had significantly lower serum levels/ratios of 
      lipoproteins than those in the control group (mean between-group differences were 
      -10.4 mg/dL, -9.7 mg/dL, -11.5 mg/dL, -0.4, and -0.3 for TC, LDLC, non-HDLC, 
      TC/HDLC, and LDLC/HDLC, respectively; all P < .05). Similar results were observed in 
      the milk group. However, no such significant differences were found between the 
      kefir and milk groups. CONCLUSION: Kefir drink causes a significant yet similar 
      improvement in serum lipid profile, compared with low-fat milk, in a dairy-rich diet 
      in overweight or obese premenopausal women.

TI  - Distinct actions of the fermented beverage kefir on host behaviour, immunity and 
      microbiome gut-brain modules in the mouse.
PG  - 67

LID - 67
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence suggests a role for the gut microbiota in modulating 
      brain physiology and behaviour, through bi-directional communication, along the 
      gut-brain axis. As such, the gut microbiota represents a potential therapeutic 
      target for influencing centrally mediated events and host behaviour. It is thus 
      notable that the fermented milk beverage kefir has recently been shown to modulate 
      the composition of the gut microbiota in mice. It is unclear whether kefirs have 
      differential effects on microbiota-gut-brain axis and whether they can modulate host 
      behaviour per se. METHODS: To address this, two distinct kefirs (Fr1 and UK4), or 
      unfermented milk control, were administered to mice that underwent a battery of 
      tests to characterise their behavioural phenotype. In addition, shotgun metagenomic 
      sequencing of ileal, caecal and faecal matter was performed, as was faecal 
      metabolome analysis. Finally, systemic immunity measures and gut serotonin levels 
      were assessed. Statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA followed by Dunnett's 
      post hoc test or Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Fr1 
      ameliorated the stress-induced decrease in serotonergic signalling in the colon and 
      reward-seeking behaviour in the saccharin preference test. On the other hand, UK4 
      decreased repetitive behaviour and ameliorated stress-induced deficits in 
      reward-seeking behaviour. Furthermore, UK4 increased fear-dependent contextual 
      memory, yet decreased milk gavage-induced improvements in long-term spatial 
      learning. In the peripheral immune system, UK4 increased the prevalence of Treg 
      cells and interleukin 10 levels, whereas Fr1 ameliorated the milk gavage 
      stress-induced elevation in neutrophil levels and CXCL1 levels. Analysis of the gut 
      microbiota revealed that both kefirs significantly changed the composition and 
      functional capacity of the host microbiota, where specific bacterial species were 
      changed in a kefir-dependent manner. Furthermore, both kefirs increased the capacity 
      of the gut microbiota to produce GABA, which was linked to an increased prevalence 
      in Lactobacillus reuteri. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these data show that kefir can 
      signal through the microbiota-gut-immune-brain axis and modulate host behaviour. In 
      addition, different kefirs may direct the microbiota toward distinct immunological 
      and behavioural modulatory effects. These results indicate that kefir can positively 
      modulate specific aspects of the microbiota-gut-brain axis and support the 
      broadening of the definition of psychobiotic to include kefir fermented foods. Video

AB  - Water kefir is a fruity, sour, slightly alcoholic and carbonated beverage, which is 
      made by fermentation of an aqueous sucrose solution in the presence of dried figs 
      and water kefir grains. These polysaccharide grains contain lactic acid bacteria 
      (LAB), yeasts, and sometimes bifidobacteria and/or acetic acid bacteria, which 
      consume sucrose to produce exopolysaccharides, lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, 
      and carbon dioxide. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing was used to examine the microbial 
      species diversity present at two time points during water kefir fermentation in 
      detail, both in the water kefir liquor and on the water kefir grains, hence 
      representing four samples. Lactobacillus harbinensis, Lactobacillus hilgardii, 
      Lactobacillus nagelii, Lactobacillus paracasei, and a Lactobacillus species similar 
      to Lactobacillus hordei/mali were present in the water kefir examined, along with 
      Bifidobacterium aquikefiri and two yeast species, namely Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      and Dekkera bruxellensis. In addition, evidence for a novel Oenococcus species 
      related to Oenococcus oeni and Oenococcus kitaharae was found. Its genome was 
      derived from the metagenome and made available under the name of Candidatus 
      Oenococcus aquikefiri. Through functional analysis of the four metagenomic data 
      sets, it was possible to link the production of lactic acid, acetic acid, ethanol, 
      and carbon dioxide to subgroups of the microbial species found. In particular, the 
      production of mannitol from fructose was linked to L. hilgardii, Candidatus O. 
      aquikefiri, and B. aquikefiri, whereas glycerol production was associated with S. 
      cerevisiae. Also, there were indications of cross-feeding, for instance in the case 
      of amino acid supply. Few bacterial species could synthesize a limited number of 
      cofactors, making them reliant on the figs or S. cerevisiae. The LAB species in turn 
      were found to be capable of contributing to water kefir grain growth, as 
      dextransucrase-encoding genes were attributed to L. hilgardii, L. hordei/mali, and 
      Candidatus O. aquikefiri.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nicotine as one of the potent psychostimulant drugs is characterized by 
      its parasympathomimetic activity. Upon the abrupt discontinuation of nicotine 
      intake, a number of symptoms such as anxiety, depression and cognition impairment 
      develop. Kefir as a food supplement is rich in tryptophan. In this study, we have 
      evaluated the effects of Kefir on nicotine cessation-induced anxiety, depression and 
      cognition impairment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty adult male rats were divided into 
      four groups. All the groups received 6 mg/kg/day of nicotine for 17 days and then 
      the negative control groups got 5 mg/kg/day of normal saline. The positive control 
      groups were given 40 mg/kg/day of Sertraline HCl for 7 days. The group treated with 
      Cow Milk Kefir (CMK) and Soy Milk Kefir (SMK) received 5 mg/kg/day for 7 days. On 
      the 25(th) day, Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), Open Field Test (OFT) and Forced Swim Test 
      (FST) were used to investigate anxiety and depression. In addition, Moris Water Maze 
      was applied to evaluate learning and memory in the animals between the 20(th) and 
      25(th) days. RESULTS: The results showed that administration of CMK, SMK and 
      Sertraline had higher anti-depression and anxiolytic effects on nicotine 
      withdrawal-induced depression and anxiety in rats (P < 0.05). Moreover, CMK and SMK 
      improved learning and memory impairment results in the nicotine withdrawal period (P 
      < 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that Kefir had a potential effect on the 
      treatment of nicotine cessation-induced depression, anxiety and cognition impairment 
      in the animal model. Kefir may be useful for adjunct therapy for nicotine 
      abandonment treatment protocols.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The popularity of fermented foods such as kefir, kuniss, and tofu has 
      been greatly increasing over the past several decades, and the ability of probiotic 
      bacteria to exert anticancer effects has recently become the focus of research. 
      While we have recently demonstrated the ability of the novel kefir product PFT 
      (Probiotics Fermentation Technology) to exert anticancer effects in vitro, here we 
      demonstrate its ability to inhibit Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) in mice. METHODS: 
      Mice were inoculated intramuscularly with EAC cells to develop solid tumors. PFT was 
      administered orally (2 g/kg/day) to mice 6 days/week, either 2 days before tumor 
      cell inoculation or 9 days after inoculation to mice bearing solid tumors. Tumor 
      growth, blood lymphocyte levels, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, apoptotic 
      regulator expression, TNF-α expression, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential 
      (MMP), PCNA, and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in tumor cells were quantitatively evaluated 
      by flow cytometry or RT-PCR. Further studies in vitro were carried out where EAC 
      cells along with several other human cancer cell lines were cultured in the presence 
      of PFT (0-5 mg/mL). Percent cell viability and IC(50) was estimated by MTT assay. 
      RESULTS: Our data shows that PFT exerts the following: 1) inhibition of tumor 
      incidence and tumor growth; 2) inhibition of cellular proliferation via a marked 
      decrease in the expression of tumor marker PCNA; 3) arrest of the tumor cell cycle 
      in the sub-G0/G1 phase, signifying apoptosis; 4) induction of apoptosis in cancer 
      cells via a mitochondrial-dependent pathway as indicated by the up-regulation of p53 
      expression, increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, decrease in the polarization of MMP, and 
      caspase-3 activation; and 5) immunomodulation with an increase in the number of 
      infiltrating CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells and an enhancement of TNF-α expression within 
      the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: PFT reduces tumor incidence and tumor growth in mice with 
      EAC by inducing apoptosis in EAC cells via the mitochondrial-dependent pathway, 
      suppressing cancer cell proliferation, and stimulating the immune system. PFT may be 
      a useful agent for cancer prevention.

      in rats.

AB  - Evidence suggests that gut microbiota dysbiosis plays a critical role in the 
      initiation and promotion of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Kefir is a fermented 
      dairy product including yeast and bacterial species. We aimed to investigate the 
      effect of kefir on trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in rats 
      using two different doses. Fifty-four Wistar rats were divided into six groups. For 
      14 days, the normal control and colitis control groups were given tap water, kefir10 
      control, kefir10 colitis, and kefir30 control, and the kefir30 colitis groups were 
      given phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% or 30% kefir, respectively, instead 
      of tap water. Colitis was induced by intracolonically administrating TNBS in the 
      colitis control, kefir10 colitis, and kefir30 colitis groups. On the 14th day, the 
      rats were sacrificed. The weights and lengths of the colons were measured and 
      macroscopically evaluated, and the distal 10 cm segments were subjected to a 
      histopathological examination. The incidence of bloody stool and diarrhea in the 
      kefir10 colitis group was found to be less than the colitis control and kefir30 
      colitis groups. The colonic weight/length ratio in the kefir10 colitis group was 
      lower than that in the colitis control and kefir30 colitis groups. We detected that 
      the 10% kefir treatment reduced TNBS-induced macroscopic colonic damage, while it 
      was exacerbated by the 30% kefir treatment. No significant difference was observed 
      between the colitis groups in terms of microscopic colonic damage scoring. These 
      results indicate that kefir, with a careful dose selection, may be a useful agent in 
      the treatment of IBD.

AB  - Kefir is a traditional dairy product with multiple probiotic characteristics derived 
      from its associated microorganisms, including more than 50 species of lactic acid 
      bacteria and yeast. For centuries, many people have produced kefir for human 
      consumption; its consumption and potential role as a probiotic supplement in 
      companion animals have never been tested. The present study explored the potential 
      application of kefir as a probiotic supplement for dogs. Kefir was orally 
      administered to healthy adult dogs (n = 6) for 2 wk. On d 0 and 14 (before and after 
      kefir consumption, respectively), gut microbiota was analyzed comprehensively using 
      quantitative PCR and 16S rDNA amplicon-based community analysis using fresh fecal 
      samples. The 16S rDNA amplicon-based community analysis showed that the relative 
      abundance of the phylum Fusobacteria was significantly decreased after kefir 
      consumption. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the families Prevotellaceae, 
      Selenomonadaceae, and Sutterellaceae increased significantly, whereas that of the 
      families Clostridiaceae, Fusobacteriaceae, and Ruminococcaceae decreased 
      significantly. The quantitative PCR assay showed that kefir consumption 
      significantly increased the population of lactic acid bacteria and the lactic acid 
      bacteria:Enterobacteriaceae ratio and significantly decreased the 
      Firmicutes:Bacteroidetes ratio. In summary, 2-wk kefir administration successfully 
      modified the gut microbiota without causing any clinically evident adverse effects. 
      Therefore, kefir could be further developed as a novel probiotic food supplement for 
      dogs to improve the quality of life of dogs.

TI  - Changes in Microbiota During Multiple Fermentation of Kefir in Different Sugar 
      Solutions Revealed by High-Throughput Sequencing.

AB  - Kefir is a fermented beverage produced through the activity of its grains, which is 
      constituted by lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria and yeasts. We studied the 
      bacterial succession during multiple fermentation of Argentinian kefir in brown 
      sugar, purified molasses or high-test molasses, using 16S high-throughput 
      sequencing. Firmicutes was dominant (up to 98% of total population) in grains and 
      beverages made from various sugar substrates, except in high-test molasses beverage, 
      which was dominated by Proteobacteria (up to 78% of total population). Major 
      bacterial species in Firmicutes were Liquorilactobacillus nagelii, 
      Lentilactobacillus hilgardii/diolivorans and Lacticaseibacillus casei/paracasei, 
      which are active in lactic acid fermentation. Proteobacteria comprised Acetobacter 
      lovaniensis and Gluconobacter oxydans/roseus as major species, which are presumably 
      responsible for the acetic acid formation in sugary kefir beverages. Bacteria differ 
      in abundance depending on the sugar type, as revealed by the competitive dominances 
      between L. nagelii and A. loveniensis. Purified molasses led to scarce acetic acid 
      bacteria during fermentation, indicating that it is not a suitable substrate for 
      their growth. Our results suggest that acetic acid (and/or ethanol) in sugary kefir 
      modulates the succession and dominance of specific lactic acid bacteria. This study 
      will provide valuable information for designing more sophisticated non-dairy 
      fermented beverages with stable microbial properties.

TI  - Kefir exhibits anti‑proliferative and pro‑apoptotic effects on colon adenocarcinoma

AB  - Kefir, a fermented milk product, exhibits anti‑tumoral activity in vivo; yet its 
      mechanism of action remains elusive. Recent studies have focused on the mechanism of 
      action of kefir on cancer cells in vitro. The current study aims at examining the 
      effect of kefir on cell survival, proliferation, and motility of colorectal cancer 
      (CRC) cells. Kefir's anti‑cancer potential was tested on CRC cell lines, Caco‑2 and 
      HT‑29, through cytotoxicity, proliferation, and apoptotic assays. The expression of 
      certain genes involved in proliferation and apoptosis was measured using reverse 
      transcriptase‑polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR) and western blotting. To assess the 
      effect of kefir on cancer metastasis, wound‑healing and time‑lapse movies, in 
      addition to collagen‑based invasion assay, were used. The results show that 
      cell‑free fractions of kefir exhibit an anti‑proliferative effect on Caco‑2 and 
      HT‑29 cells. Analysis of DNA content by flow cytometry revealed the ability of kefir 
      to induce cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Kefir was also found to induce 
      apoptosis, as seen by cell death ELISA. Results from RT‑PCR showed that kefir 
      decreases the expression of transforming growth factor α (TGF‑α); and transforming 
      growth factor‑β1 (TGF‑β1) in HT‑29 cells. Western blotting results revealed an 
      upregulation in Bax:Bcl‑2 ratio, confirming the pro‑apoptotic effect of kefir, and 
      an increase in p53 independent‑p21 expression upon kefir treatment. MMP expression 
      was not altered by kefir treatment. Furthermore, results from time‑lapse motility 
      movies, wound‑healing, and invasion assays showed no effect on the motility of 
      colorectal as well as breast (MCF‑7 and MB‑MDA‑231) cancer cells upon kefir 
      treatment. Our data suggest that kefir is able to inhibit the proliferation and 
      induce apoptosis in HT‑29 and Caco‑2 CRC cells, yet it does not exhibit a 
      significant effect on the motility and invasion of these cells in vitro.

AB  - Integrated metabolomic and metagenomic techniques were used to study the metabolite 
      dynamics and phytochemistry of a soy whey-based beverage bio-transformed by water 
      kefir consortium. The UPLC- MS/MS and HPLC-ESI-MS metabolite quantification and the 
      OPLS-DA result showed that the kefir consortium induced a significant change in the 
      metabolite composition and altered the phytochemistry of the fermented beverage. 
      Bioactive peptide analogues, flavonoids, and glycerophospholipids including 
      N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine, acetyl-DL-leucine; tephcalostan, wogonin, pelargonin, 
      genistein, daidzein, and glycerophosphoserines (PS), glycerophosphoethanolamines 
      (PE) respectively were synthesized while flavonoid glycosides and soyasaponins were 
      degraded in the novel beverage. Furthermore, the beverage showed high ACE inhibitory 
      and DPPH radical scavenging activity of 92.31% and 87.51% respectively. 
      Lactobacillus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Pichia membranifaciens were the 
      predominant microbial groups in the new beverage as revealed by the metagenomic 
      sequence analysis. The study thus provides discrete data evidence that kefir 
      consortium is a viable starter for transforming soy whey into a bioactive beverage.

AB  - This investigation aimed to investigate the viability of kefir enrichment with 
      mucilage extracted from faba bean and chickpea. Four formulations of kefir were 
      studied: fermented milk (control), milk with 3% of faba bean mucilage, milk with 3% 
      of chickpea mucilage and milk with 3% of inulin from artichoke (as prebiotic 
      control). Kefirs were evaluated during 28 days' storage time at refrigerated 
      temperature. Microbial viability, physicochemical properties (total titratable 
      acidity, syneresis and pH), rheological properties (flow and dynamic shear rheology) 
      and consumer's acceptability were evaluated. The number of bacteria significantly 
      increased during storage period in all the formulations. The pH decreases during 
      storage whereas total titratable acidity increased as was expected. Kefir 
      supplemented with mucilage showed slightly lower but not significantly different 
      sensory acceptability scores in comparison to the control. The novel mucilage 
      ingredients could be prebiotic source for improving kefir quality.

AB  - This study aimed at assessing the effects of Kefir, a probiotic fermented milk, on 
      oxidative stress in diabetic animals. The induction of diabetes was achieved in 
      adult male Wistar rats using streptozotocin (STZ). The animals were distributed into 
      four groups as follows: control (CTL); control Kefir (CTLK); diabetic (DM) and 
      diabetic Kefir (DMK). Starting on the 5th day of diabetes, Kefir was administered by 
      daily gavage at a dose of 1.8 mL/day for 8 weeks. Before and after Kefir treatment, 
      the rats were placed in individual metabolic cages to obtain blood and urine samples 
      to evaluate urea, creatinine, proteinuria, nitric oxide (NO), thiobarbituric acid 
      reactive substances (TBARS) and C-reactive protein (CRP). After sacrificing the 
      animals, the renal cortex was removed for histology, oxidative stress and NOS 
      evaluation. When compared to CTL rats, DM rats showed increased levels of glycemia, 
      plasmatic urea, proteinuria, renal NO, superoxide anion, TBARS, and plasmatic CRP; 
      also demonstrated a reduction in urinary urea, creatinine, and NO. However, DMK rats 
      showed a significant improvement in most of these parameters. Despite the lack of 
      differences observed in the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), the 
      expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was significantly lower in the DMK group 
      when compared to DM rats, as assessed by Western blot analysis. Moreover, the DMK 
      group presented a significant reduction of glycogen accumulation within the renal 
      tubules when compared to the DM group. These results indicate that Kefir treatment 
      may contribute to better control of glycemia and oxidative stress, which is 
      associated with the amelioration of renal function, suggesting its use as a 
      non-pharmacological adjuvant to delay the progression of diabetic complications.

TI  - Assessment of commercial companion animal kefir products for label accuracy of 
      microbial composition and quantity.
LID - 10.1093/jas/skaa301 [doi]
LID - skaa301
AB  - Kefir is a fermented beverage containing yeast and bacteria produced by the 
      fermentation of water or milk with kefir grains. Lack of regulation for 
      probiotic-containing fermented food sold for companion dogs and cats creates the 
      potential for misreporting on viable microbial counts, taxonomy, and label claims. 
      In this study, the microbiota of six companion animal kefir products were measured 
      quantitatively using standard plating techniques. Microbial composition of these 
      products was also characterized by using high-resolution, long-read amplicon 
      sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Five products (83%) listed specific microorganisms, 
      and four products (66%) guaranteed colony forming units (CFU)/g on their label. To 
      enumerate viable lactic acid bacteria (LAB), two lots of each homogenized product 
      were plated upon opening and following 14 d on deMan Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) agar 
      and incubated under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Results from point of opening 
      revealed that all commercial kefir products with a guaranteed CFU/g overstated the 
      number of microorganisms present by at least 1 log, with only one product exceeding 
      1 × 109 CFU/g. Sequencing results demonstrated that none of the labels claiming 
      specific bacterial genera and species on their labels were correct, and all products 
      contained at least three additional bacterial species above the minimum detectable 
      threshold (0.001% relative abundance) that were not disclosed by the manufacturer. 
      In addition to the incorrect viable CFU and bacterial taxonomies, several of the 
      product labels and websites contained a wide range of health claims, none of which 
      are supported by the companion animal literature. Our results demonstrate a low 
      level of accuracy in the labeling of commercial kefir products intended for use in 
      dogs and cats. Regulatory agencies, veterinarians, pet food professionals, and pet 
      owners must scrutinize these products and demand a higher level of accuracy and 
      quality in the future.

AB  - Water kefir is an acid, softly alcoholic and fragrant beverage fermented by a stable 
      consortium of multispecies microbial community. Aim of this study was to investigate 
      the ability of water kefir grains to abate significant amounts of heavy metal ions 
      during the preparation of the water kefir beverage and to set up an experimental and 
      analytical methodology based on ICP-OES spectroscopy and ionic chromatography for 
      the evaluation of heavy metal bioaccumulation by water kefir grains. We investigated 
      the absorption kinetics of the process. The use of EPR spectroscopy enabled us to 
      characterize the interaction between water kefir grains and paramagnetic metal ions 
      from the structural viewpoint. Our results highlight significant differences in both 
      the kinetics and the structural aspects of the interaction between distinct metal 
      ions and water kefir grains. They concur clarifying the potential role of water 
      kefir grains as detoxifying agents towards heavy metal ions.

TI  - Brazilian Kefir-Fermented Sheep's Milk, a Source of Antimicrobial and Antioxidant 
      Peptides.
PG  - 446-455
LID - 10.1007/s12602-017-9365-8 [doi]
AB  - Fermented milks are a source of bioactive peptides and may be considered as 
      functional foods. Among these, sheep's milk fermented with kefir has not been widely 
      studied and its most relevant properties need to be more thoroughly characterized. 
      This research study is set out to investigate and evaluate the antioxidant and 
      antimicrobial properties of peptides from fermented sheep's milk in Brazil when 
      produced by using kefir. For this, the chemical and microbiological composition of 
      the sheep's milk before and after the fermentation was evaluated. The changes in the 
      fermented milk and the peptides extracted before the fermentation and in the 
      fermented milk during its shelf life were verified. The antimicrobial and 
      antioxidant activities of the peptides from the fermented milk were evaluated and 
      identified according to the literature. The physicochemical properties and mineral 
      profile of the fermented milk were like those of fresh milk. The peptide extract 
      presented antimicrobial activity and it was detected that 13 of the 46 peptides were 
      able to inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms. A high antioxidant activity 
      was observed in the peptides extracted from fermented milk (3.125 mg/mL) on the 28th 
      day of storage. Two fractions displayed efficient radical scavenging properties by 
      DPPH and ABTS methods. At least 11 peptides distributed in the different fractions 
      were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. This sheep's milk fermented by 
      Brazilian kefir grains, which has antioxidant and antimicrobial activities and 
      probiotic microorganisms, is a good candidate for further investigation as a source 
      for bioactive peptides. The fermentation process was thus a means by which to 
      produce potential bioactive peptides.

AB  - Kefir is a probiotic beverage containing over 50 species of lactic acid bacteria and 
      yeast. In this study, the anti-obesity and anti-non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
      (NAFLD) effects of kefir were comprehensively addressed along with targeted and 
      untargeted community analysis of the fecal microbiota in a high-fat diet 
      (HFD)-induced obese mouse model. HFD-fed C57BL/6 mice were orally administrated 
      either kefir or milk (control) once a day for 12 weeks, and body and organ weight, 
      fecal microbiota and mycobiota, histopathology, blood cholesterol and cytokines and 
      gene expressions were analyzed. Compared to the control, mice in the kefir group 
      exhibited a significantly lower body weight (34.18 g vs. 40.24 g; p=0.00004) and 
      histopathological liver lesion score (1.13 vs. 3.25; p=0.002). Remarkably, the 
      kefir-fed mice also harbored more Lactobacillus/Lactococcus (7.01 vs. 6.32 log 
      CFU/g), total yeast (6.07 vs. 5.01 log CFU/g) and Candida (5.56 vs. 3.88 log CFU/g). 
      Kefir administration also up-regulated genes related to fatty acid oxidation, PPARα 
      and AOX, in both the liver and adipose tissue (PPARα, 2.95- and 2.15-fold; AOX, 
      1.89- and 1.9-fold, respectively). The plasma concentration of IL-6, a 
      proinflammatory marker, was significantly reduced following kefir consumption (50.39 
      pg/ml vs. 111.78 pg/ml; p=0.03). Strikingly, the populations of 
      Lactobacillus/Lactococcus, total yeast and Candida were strongly correlated with 
      PPARα gene expression in adipose and hepatic tissue (r=0.599, 0.580 and 0.562, 
      respectively). These data suggest that kefir consumption modulates gut microbiota 
      and mycobiota in HFD-fed mice, which prevents obesity and NAFLD via promoting fatty 
      acid oxidation.

TI  - Kefir grains as a starter for whey fermentation at different temperatures: chemical 
      and microbiological characterisation.
PG  - 262-71
LID - 10.1017/S0022029912000179 [doi]
AB  - We report here a comparative analysis of the growth, acidification capacity, and 
      chemical and microbiologic composition between kefir grains after 20 subcultures in 
      whey at 20, 30, and 37°C and the original kefir grains coming from milk along with a 
      determination of the microbiological composition of the fermented whey as compared 
      with that of traditional fermented milk. When fermentation was carried out 
      repeatedly at 30 or 37°C, kefir grains changed their kefir-like appearance, 
      exhibited reduced growth rates, had a lower diversity of yeasts and water content, 
      and a higher protein-to-polysaccharide ratio compared with the original kefir 
      grains. In contrast, at 20°C kefir grains could remain in whey for prolonged periods 
      without altering their acidification capacity, growth rate, macroscopic appearance 
      or chemical and microbiologic composition-with the only difference being a reduction 
      in certain yeast populations after 20 subcultures in whey. At this incubation 
      temperature, the presence of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, Lb. kefir, Lb. 
      parakefir, Lactococcus lactis, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces unisporus, and 
      Sac. cerevisiae was detected in kefir grains and in fermented whey by 
      denaturing-gradient-gel electrophoresis (DGGE). In whey fermented at 20°C the number 
      of lactic-acid bacteria (LAB) was significantly lower (P<0·05) and the number of 
      yeast significantly higher (P<0·05) than in fermented milk. Since the DGGE profiles 
      were similar for both products, at this temperature the microbiologic composition of 
      fermented whey is similar to that of fermented milk. We therefore suggest a 
      temperature of 20°C to preserve kefir grains as whey-fermentation starters.

TI  - Kefir: a symbiotic yeasts-bacteria community with alleged healthy capabilities.
PG  - 67-74
AB  - Kefir is a fermented milk beverage. The milk fermentation is achieved by the of 
      kefir grains, a cluster of microorganisms held together by a polysaccharide matrix 
      named kefiran. Kefir grains are an example of symbiosis between yeast and bacteria. 
      They have been used over years to produce kefir, a fermented beverage that is 
      consumed all over the world, although its origin is Caucasian. A vast variety of 
      different species of organisms forming the kefir grains, comprising yeast and 
      bacteria, have been isolated and identified. Kefir is a probiotic food. Probiotics 
      have shown to be beneficial to health, being presently of great interest to the food 
      industry. Kefir has been accredited with antibacterial, antifungal and antitumoural 
      activities among other beneficial attributes. This review includes a critical 
      revision of the microbiological composition of kefir along with its beneficial 
      properties to human health.

      Bacteria on Inflammation and High-Fat Diet-Induced Obesity.
PG  - 15157-15164
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.1c05037 [doi]
AB  - The antiobesity action of nonviable probiotic lactic acid bacteria (PLAB) may be 
      attributed to bacterial cellular components recognized by host cells. The 
      anti-inflammation and antiobesity properties of surface layer proteins (SLPs) that 
      are cellular components isolated from kefir PLAB were determined in macrophage RAW 
      264.7 cells and obese mice. Kefir SLPs significantly decreased secretion of IL-6 and 
      production of NF-kB p65 protein by LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells in a dose-response 
      manner. C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat (HF) diet with oral administration of 
      either saline (CON) or kefir SLPs for 6 weeks. SLPs significantly improved body 
      weight gain and adipose tissue weight, plasma triglyceride concentrations, and 
      insulin resistance. Profiling of adipocyte gene expression showed that the 
      antiobesity effect was significantly related to the expression of genes associated 
      with adipogenesis, autophagy, and inflammatory/immune response, and fatty acid 
      oxidation. Taken together, SLPs are a novel bioactive component in kefir PLABs to 
      target obesity and obesity-related disorders.

AB  - The effects of bisphenol A (BPA) contamination on the cardiovascular function still 
      are not clear. Here, we evaluated the vascular effects of BPA and the protective 
      actions of kefir in infant rats. Animals (25 days old) were treated with BPA (100 
      μg/Kg/day) for 60 days (BPA group), or administered kefir (0.3 mL/100 g) in addition 
      to BPA (BPA kefir group), compared with non-treated rats (Control group).The 
      vascular endothelial function was evaluated in aortic rings through the relaxation 
      response to acetylcholine and specific blockers. The balance between reactive oxygen 
      species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) was assessed through flow cytometry in the 
      vascular tissue. The BPA group developed high blood pressure (+10%) and the analysis 
      of vascular reactivity showed an impaired ACh-induced relaxation (~80%). The further 
      analysis by using NADPH, NOS and COX blockers revealed that the impaired 
      vasorelaxation was due to increased ROS production (+12%), NO bioavailability (-12%) 
      and increased vasoconstriction to prostanoids (+36%) compared with the Control 
      group. Kefir treatment reverted those effects significantly. Analysis of the aortic 
      cells showed increased •O(2)(-) production (1942±39 a.u.) and decreased NO 
      bioavailability (1250±30 a.u.) compared with the Control group (1374±146 and 2777±25 
      a.u., P<.05) and kefir reverted these values (1298±57 and 2517±57 a.u.). 
      Contamination by BPA in this model caused hypertension and endothelial dysfunction 
      and it was accompanied by a vascular ROS/NO imbalance, damage of endothelial layer 
      and pro-apoptotic effects. The novelty is that the treatment using probiotic kefir 
      was able to attenuate the progression the above BPA effects.

TI  - Kefir peptides prevent high-fructose corn syrup-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver 
      disease in a murine model by modulation of inflammation and the JAK2 signaling 
      pathway.
PG  - e237
LID - 10.1038/nutd.2016.49 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In recent years, people have changed their eating habits, and 
      high-fructose-containing bubble tea has become very popular. High-fructose intake 
      has been suggested to be a key factor that induces non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
      (NAFLD). Kefir, a fermented milk product composed of microbial symbionts, has 
      demonstrated numerous biological activities, including antibacterial, antioxidant 
      and immunostimulating effects. The present study aims to evaluate the effects of 
      kefir peptides on high-fructose-induced hepatic steatosis and the possible molecular 
      mechanism. RESULTS: An animal model of 30% high-fructose-induced NAFLD in C57BL/6J 
      mice was established. The experiment is divided into the following six groups: (1) 
      normal: H(2)O drinking water; (2) mock: H(2)O+30% fructose; (3) KL: low-dose kefir 
      peptides (50 mg kg(-1))+30% fructose; (4) KM: medium-dose kefir peptides 
      (100 mg kg(-1))+30% fructose; (5) KH: high-dose kefir peptides (150 mg kg(-1))+30% 
      fructose; and (6) CFM: commercial fermented milk (100 mg kg(-1))+30% fructose. The 
      results show that kefir peptides improve fatty liver syndrome by decreasing body 
      weight, serum alanine aminotransferase, triglycerides, insulin and hepatic 
      triglycerides, cholesterol, and free fatty acids as well as the inflammatory 
      cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) that had been elevated in fructose-induced NAFLD 
      mice. In addition, kefir peptides markedly increased phosphorylation of AMPK to 
      downregulate its targeted enzymes, ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) and SREBP-1c (sterol 
      regulatory element-binding protein 1), and inhibited de novo lipogenesis. 
      Furthermore, kefir peptides activated JAK2 to stimulate STAT3 phosphorylation, which 
      can translocate to the nucleus, and upregulated several genes, including the CPT1 
      (carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1) involved in fatty acid oxidation. CONCLUSION: Our 
      data have demonstrated that kefir peptides can improve the symptoms of NAFLD, 
      including body weight, energy intake, inflammatory reaction and the formation of 
      fatty liver by activating JAK2 signal transduction through the JAK2/STAT3 and 
      JAK2/AMPK pathways in the high-fructose-induced fatty liver animal model. Therefore, 
      kefir peptides may have the potential for clinical application for the prevention or 
      treatment of clinical metabolic syndrome.

      from water kefir.
PG  - 1627-1637

AB  - Water kefir is a fermented beverage employing a natural microbial consortium, which 
      harbours bifidobacteria, namely Bifidobacterium aquikefiri and Bifidobacterium 
      tibiigranuli. However, little information is available on their metabolic properties 
      or role in the consortium. In this study, we combined genomic and physiologic 
      investigations to predict and characterize the properties of these organisms and 
      their possible role in the consortium. When comparing the genomes of these 
      psychrotrophic organisms with that of the three selected mesophilic probiotic 
      Bifidobacterium strains, we could find 143 genes shared by the 3 known isolates of 
      bifidobacteria from water kefir that do not occur in the probiotic strains. These 
      include genes involved in acid and oxygen tolerance. In addition, their genomically 
      predicted carbohydrate usage and transport suggest adaptation to sucrose and other 
      plant-related sugars. Furthermore, they proved prototrophic for all amino acids in 
      vitro, which enables them to cope with the strong amino acid limitation in water 
      kefir.

TI  - Kefir reduces insulin resistance and inflammatory cytokine expression in an animal 
      model of metabolic syndrome.
PG  - 3390-401
LID - 10.1039/c6fo00339g [doi]
AB  - There is growing evidence that kefir can be a promising tool in decreasing the risk 
      of many diseases, including metabolic syndrome (MetS). The aim of the present study 
      was to evaluate the effect of kefir supplementation in the diet of Spontaneously 
      Hypertensive Rats (SHR) in which MetS was induced with monosodium glutamate (MSG), 
      and to determine its effect on metabolic parameters, inflammatory and oxidation 
      marker expression and glycemic index control. Thirty animals were used in this 
      experiment. For the induction of MetS, twenty two-day-old male SHR received five 
      consecutive intradermal injections of MSG. For the Negative Control, ten newborn 
      male SHR received intradermal injections of saline solution (0.9% saline solution). 
      After weaning, animals received standard diet and water ad libitum until reaching 3 
      months old, for the development of MetS. They were then divided into three groups (n 
      = 10): negative control (NC, 1 mL saline solution per day), positive control (PC, 1 
      mL saline solution per day) and the Kefir group (1 mL kefir per day). Feeding was 
      carried out by gavage for 10 weeks and the animals received standard food and water 
      ad libitum. Obesity, insulin resistance, pro- and anti-inflammatory markers, and the 
      histology of pancreatic and adipose tissues were among the main variables evaluated. 
      Compared to the PC group, kefir supplementation reduced plasma triglycerides, liver 
      lipids, liver triglycerides, insulin resistance, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, 
      thoracic circumference, abdominal circumference, products of lipid oxidation, 
      pro-inflammatory cytokine expression (IL-1β) and increased anti-inflammatory 
      cytokine expression (IL-10). The present findings indicate that kefir has the 
      potential to benefit the management of MetS.

AB  - Bifidobacteria constitute one of the dominant groups of microorganisms colonizing 
      the human gut of infants. Their ability to utilize various host-derived glycans as 
      well as dietary carbohydrates has received considerable scientific attention. 
      However, very little is known about the role of fermented foods, such as kefir, or 
      their constituent glycans, such as kefiran, as substrates for bifidobacterial growth 
      and for the modulation of the expression of bifidobacterial host-effector molecules. 
      Here, we show that Bifidobacterium bifidum PRL2010 exhibits high growth performance 
      among the bifidobacterial strains tested when cultivated on kefir and/or kefiran 
      polymer. Furthermore, a 16S rRNA metagenomic approach revealed that the microbiota 
      of kefir is modified upon the addition of PRL2010 cells to the kefir matrix. 
      Finally, our results show that kefir and kefiran are able to influence the 
      transcriptome of B. bifidum PRL2010 causing increased transcription of genes 
      involved in the metabolism of dietary glycans as well as genes that act as 
      host-microbe effector molecules such as pili. Altogether, these data support the use 
      of kefir as a valuable means for the delivery of effective microbial cells in 
      probiotic therapy.

TI  - Comparative in vitro efficacy of kefir produced from camel, goat, ewe and cow milk 
      on Haemonchus contortus.

AB  - One of the great challenges of veterinary parasitology is the search for alternative 
      methods for controlling gastrointestinal parasites in small ruminants. Milk kefir is 
      a traditional source of probiotic, with great therapeutic potential. The objective 
      of this study was to investigate the anthelmintic effects of kefir on the abomasal 
      nematode Haemonchus contortus from sheep. The study used camel, goat, ewe and cow 
      milk as a starting material, to produce camel, goat, cow and ewe milk kefir. All 
      kefirs showed a significant concentration-dependent effect on H. contortus egg 
      hatching at all tested concentrations. The highest inhibition (100%) of eggs was 
      observed with camel milk kefir at a concentration 0.125 mg/ml. In relation to the 
      effect of kefirs on the survival of adult parasites, all kefirs induced 
      concentration-dependent mortality in adults, with variable results. The complete 
      mortality (100%) of adults of H. contortus occurred at concentrations in the range 
      0.25-2 mg/ml. The highest inhibition of motility (100%) of worms was observed after 
      8 h post exposure with camel milk kefir at 0.25 mg/ml. These findings indicate that 
      kefir can be considered a potential tool to control haemonchosis in sheep. Further 
      investigations are needed to assess the active molecules in kefir responsible for 
      its anthelmintic properties and to investigate similar in vivo effects.

TI  - Profiling of Multiphosphorylated Peptides in Kefir and Their Release During 
      Simulated Gastrointestinal Digestion.
PG  - 7963-7970
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.8b03105 [doi]
AB  - Casein phosphopeptides are multiphosphorylated milk peptides, which can have 
      anticariogenic activity and improve mineral absorption by binding bivalent metal 
      ions. The present study investigated phosphopeptides in kefir because fermentation 
      may lead to their enhanced release from milk proteins. After selective enrichment by 
      hydroxyapatite extraction, phosphopeptides and their phosphorylation degree were 
      identified by matrix-assisted desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry 
      (MALDI-TOF-MS) before and after enzymatic dephosphorylation. Peptide structures were 
      determined by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray 
      ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS) revealing 27 phosphopeptides 
      in kefir, including nine peptides containing the motif pSpSpSEE, which binds 
      minerals most efficiently. The majority (18) of phosphopeptides were derived from 
      β-casein, but only three were derived from the most abundant milk protein 
      α(s1)-casein. After simulated gastrointestinal digestion, MALDI-TOF-MS analysis 
      detected eight putative phosphopeptides in kefir, four of which were assigned by 
      UHPLC-ESI-MS/MS to α(s2)-casein(124-133), α(s2)-casein(137-146), β-casein(30-40), 
      and κ-casein(147-161). These results indicate that kefir is a good dietary source of 
      multiphosphorylated peptides.

AB  - Cereal-based functional beverages represent social, economic, and environmental 
      sustainable opportunities to cope with emerging trends in food consumption and 
      global nutrition. Here we report, for the first time, the polyphasic 
      characterization of three cereal-based kefir-like riboflavin-enriched beverages, 
      obtained from oat, maize and barley flours, and their comparison with classical 
      milk-based kefir. The four matrices were successfully fermented with commercial 
      starters: i) milk-kefir and ii) water-kefir, proving the potential of cereal 
      ingredients in the formulation of dairy-like fermented beverages with milk-kefir 
      starter behavior better in these matrices. In the light of their potentiality, seven 
      riboflavin-producing Andean Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) were tested for tolerance to 
      food stresses commonly encountered during food fermentation. Moreover, the LAB 
      strains investigated were screened for spontaneous riboflavin overproducing 
      derivatives. Lactobacillus plantarum M5MA1-B2 with outstanding response to stress, 
      was selected to improve riboflavin content in an in situ fortification approach. The 
      combination of L. plantarum M5MA1-B2 riboflavin overproducing strain with milk kefir 
      starter in oat, lead to cover, for one serving of 100 g, 11.4% of Recommended 
      Dietary Allowance (RDA). Besides, addition of L. plantarum M5MA1-B2 improved 
      performance of water kefir in oat and maize matrices. Proton Transfer Reaction 
      Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) analysis provided the on-line Volatile 
      Organic Compounds profiles supporting the best combination of starter, LAB and 
      cereal matrix for novel functional foods development.

TI  - Removal of cadmium by Lactobacillus kefir as a protective tool against toxicity.
PG  - 280-7
LID - 10.1017/S0022029914000314 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the capacity of Lactobacillus kefir strains to 
      remove cadmium cations and protect eukaryotic cells from cadmium toxicity. Lb. kefir 
      CIDCA 8348 and JCM 5818 were grown in a 1/2 dilution of MRS broth supplemented with 
      Cd(NO3)2 ranging 0 to 1 mM. Growth kinetics were followed during 76 h at 30 °C by 
      registering optical density at 600 nm every 4-10 h. The accumulated concentration of 
      cadmium was determined on cultures in the stationary phase by atomic absorption. The 
      viability of a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2) upon exposure to (a) free cadmium 
      and (b) cadmium previously incubated with Lb. kefir strains was evaluated by 
      determining the mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity. Lb. kefir strains were able to 
      grow and tolerate concentrations of cadmium cations up to 1 mM. The addition of 
      cadmium to the culture medium increased the lag time in all the concentrations used. 
      However, a decrease of the total biomass (maximum Absorbance) was observed only at 
      concentrations above 0.0012 and 0.0011 mM for strains CIDCA 8348 and JCM 5818, 
      respectively. Shorter and rounder lactobacilli were observed in both strains upon 
      microscopic observations. Moreover, dark precipitates compatible with intracellular 
      precipitation of cadmium were observed in the cytoplasm of both strains. The ability 
      of Lb. kefir to protect eukaryotic cells cultures from cadmium toxicity was analysed 
      using HepG2 cells lines. Concentrations of cadmium greater than 3×10(-3) mM strongly 
      decreased the viability of HepG2 cells. However, when the eukaryotic cells were 
      exposed to cadmium pre-incubated 1 h with Lb. kefir the toxicity of cadmium was 
      considerably lower, Lb. kefir JCM 5818 being more efficient. The high tolerance and 
      binding capacity of Lb. kefir strains to cadmium concentrations largely exceeding 
      the tolerated weekly intake (TWI) of cadmium for food (2.5 μg per kg of body weight) 
      and water (3 μg/l) addressed to human consumption, is an important added value when 
      thinking in health-related applications.

TI  - Synergistic Effects of Heat-Killed Kefir Paraprobiotics and Flavonoid-Rich 
      Prebiotics on Western Diet-Induced Obesity.

AB  - The synergistic anti-obesity effect of paraprobiotic heat-killed lactic acid 
      bacteria (HLAB) and prebiotics has not been studied. To determine the anti-obesity 
      properties of prebiotic polyphenol-rich wine grape seed flour (GSF) and 
      paraprobiotic HLAB, C57BL/6J mice were administered a high-fat and high-fructose 
      diet (HFFrD) with 5% microcrystalline cellulose (CON), HFFrD supplemented with 2.5% 
      GSF, HFFrD with orally administered HLAB, or HFFrD with a combination of GSF and 
      orally administered HLAB (GSF+HLAB) for 8 weeks. Compared with the CON group, the 
      GSF and HLAB groups both showed significant reductions in HFFrD-induced body weight 
      gain and adipose tissue weights (p < 0.05). Interestingly, combined supplementation 
      with GSF and HLAB revealed statistically significant synergistic effects on body 
      weight gain, visceral adiposity, and plasma triacylglycerol concentrations (p < 
      0.05). The synergistic action was significantly related to a decreased adipocyte 
      gene expression in fatty acid synthesis and inflammation metabolism. In conclusion, 
      the combination of prebiotic GSF and paraprobiotic kefir HLAB is potentially useful, 
      as natural food ingredients, in the prevention of obesity and obesity-related 
      diseases, especially for immunocompromised individuals.

AB  - Kefir is an artisanal product that is gaining scientific attention due to its 
      increase in consumption attributed to its potential health benefits. The effect on 
      the quality attributes of kefir grains of different origin (household and 
      commercial) and preserved with different methods (drying and freezing) was evaluated 
      to standardize a domestic and semi-industrial process. Chemical (protein, lactose. 
      lactic acid, ethanol, and acetic acid) as well as microbial properties (total plate 
      count and total yeast count) were monitored during the experiment. Results show a 
      statistical difference between the kefir grains in terms of acetic acid and ethanol 
      percentages, which leads to the conclusion that there is a difference in the 
      microbial populations that produce these products. Lactic acid, protein, and lactose 
      parameters are statistically the same as well as the growth in biomass and the total 
      population of yeast. Our results suggest that both types of kefir grains maintain a 
      similar performance and that their metabolic capabilities are stable throughout time 
      (taking into account that the household grains have been productive for years), 
      meaning that domestic or semi-industrial processes could be easily standardized.

      intestinal pathogens.

AB  - Kefir is a fermented milk obtained by the activity of kefir grains which are 
      composed of lactic and acetic acid bacteria, and yeasts. Many beneficial health 
      effects have been associated with kefir consumption such as stimulation of the 
      immune system and inhibition of pathogenic microorganisms. The biological activity 
      of kefir may be attributed to the presence of a complex microbiota as well as the 
      microbial metabolites that are released during fermentation. The aim of this work 
      was to characterise the non-microbial fraction of kefir and to study its antagonism 
      against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Bacillus cereus. During milk 
      fermentation there was a production of organic acids, mainly lactic and acetic acid, 
      with a consequent decrease in pH and lactose content. The non-microbial fraction of 
      kefir added to nutrient broth at concentrations above 75% v/v induced a complete 
      inhibition of pathogenic growth that could be ascribed to the presence of 
      un-dissociated lactic acid. In vitro assays using an intestinal epithelial cell 
      model indicated that pre-incubation of cells with the non-microbial fraction of 
      kefir did not modify the association/invasion of Salmonella whereas pre-incubation 
      of Salmonella with this fraction under conditions that did not affect their 
      viability significantly decreased the pathogen's ability to invade epithelial cells. 
      Lactate exerted a protective effect against Salmonella in a mouse model, 
      demonstrating the relevance of metabolites present in the non-microbial fraction of 
      kefir produced during milk fermentation.

TI  - Therapeutic effects of kefir grain Lactobacillus-derived extracellular vesicles in 
      mice with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - Kefir is a fermented product from yeast and lactic acid bacteria, and has been 
      associated with various health benefits including relieving inflammatory bowel 
      disease. Recently, it has been shown that gram-positive bacteria produce 
      extracellular vesicles (EV). The EV could be appearing as potentially important 
      mediators of cell to cell interaction. In this study, we explored the role of kefir 
      grain Lactobacillus-derived EV in modulating inflammation responses via alleviating 
      the production of inflammatory cytokines in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced 
      inflammation in Caco-2 cells and the 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced 
      inflammatory bowel disease mouse model. Kefir-derived Lactobacillus EV were isolated 
      by ultracentrifugation of the culture medium of 3 different kefir-derived strains 
      (i.e., Lactobacillus kefir, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, and Lactobacillus 
      kefirgranum). Nanoparticle tracking analysis showed that the size of isolated 
      kefir-derived Lactobacillus EV was within 80 to 400 nm, and kefir-derived 
      Lactobacillus EV uptake into recipient Caco-2 cells was confirmed by fluorescence 
      labeling. Treatment of each kefir-derived Lactobacillus EV onto TNF-α-stimulated 
      Caco-2 cells significantly reduced the level of both mRNA expression and secretion 
      of IL-8, and Western blot analysis revealed that such an effect was related to 
      inhibition of TNF-α signaling mediated by reducing the phosphorylation of p65, a 
      subunit of NF-kB. Subsequent administration of kefir-derived Lactobacillus EV into 
      inflammatory bowel disease-induced mice significantly alleviated the body weight 
      loss and rectal bleeding, and enhanced stool consistency. Histological examination 
      showed that kefir-derived Lactobacillus EV substantially reduced the infiltration of 
      transmural leukocytes and loss of goblet cells within the colon, and the serum level 
      of myeloperoxidase was significantly lower in the EV-treated group than control 
      group. Our study demonstrates that kefir-derived Lactobacillus EV can be potentially 
      used for developing innovative strategies for alleviating inflammatory bowel 
      disease.

TI  - Kefir drink leads to a similar weight loss, compared with milk, in a dairy-rich 
      non-energy-restricted diet in overweight or obese premenopausal women: a randomized 
      controlled trial.
PG  - 295-304

AB  - PURPOSE: Controversy exists regarding whether increasing dairy intake without energy 
      restriction would lead to weight loss. We aimed to compare the potential 
      weight-reducing effects of kefir drink (a probiotic dairy product) and milk in a 
      dairy-rich non-energy-restricted diet in overweight or obese premenopausal women. 
      METHODS: One hundred and forty-four subjects were assessed for eligibility in this 
      single-center, multi-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial. Of these, 
      seventy-five eligible women aged 25-45 years were randomly assigned to three groups, 
      labeled as control, milk, and kefir, to receive an outpatient dietary regimen for 8 
      weeks. Subjects in the control group received a diet providing a maintenance level 
      of energy intake, containing 2 servings/day of low-fat dairy products, while those 
      in the milk and kefir groups received a weight maintenance diet, containing 2 
      additional servings/day (a total of 4 servings/day) of dairy products from low-fat 
      milk or commercial kefir drink, respectively. Anthropometric outcomes including 
      weight, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference (WC) were measured every 2 
      weeks. RESULTS: Fifty-eight subjects completed the study. Using analysis of 
      covariance models in the intention-to-treat population (n = 75), we found that at 8 
      weeks, subjects in the kefir and milk groups had significantly greater reductions in 
      weight, BMI, and WC compared to those in the control group (all p < 0.01). However, 
      no such significant differences were found between the kefir and milk groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Kefir drink leads to a similar weight loss, compared with milk, in a 
      dairy-rich non-energy-restricted diet in overweight or obese premenopausal women. 
      However, further studies are warranted.

TI  - Dietary high-fructose reduces barrier proteins and activates mitogenic signalling in 
      the testis of a rat model: Regulatory effects of kefir supplementation.

AB  - There are limited data on the influence of fructose rich diet on the male 
      reproductive system. Kefir may have health beneficial effects, but its mechanism of 
      action remains mostly unclear. Herein, we investigated the impact of dietary high 
      fructose on tight junction proteins and mitogenic pathways in rat testis as well as 
      their modulation by kefir supplementation. Twenty-two male Wistar rats (4 weeks old) 
      were divided into the following three groups: Control; Fructose; Fructose + Kefir. 
      Fructose was added to drinking water at concentration of 20% and administered to the 
      rats for 15 weeks and kefir was supplemented by gavage once a day during final 
      6 weeks. Dietary fructose-induced testicular degeneration was associated with the 
      downregulation of the blood-testis barrier proteins, claudin-11 and N-cadherin as 
      well as SIRT1 expression in testicular tissue of rats. However, p38MAPK, p-p38MAPK 
      and p-ERK1/2 levels were increased in testis of fructose-fed rats. Interestingly, 
      JNK1 and p-JNK1 protein levels were decreased following this dietary intervention. 
      Raf1, ERK1/2, and caspase 3 and TUNEL staining of the testis reveal the activation 
      of apoptosis due to fructose intake. Kefir supplementation markedly promoted the 
      expression of claudin-11, SIRT1, JNK1 and p-JNK1 but suppressed testicular mitogenic 
      and apoptotic factors in fructose-fed rats.

TI  - Probiotic Potential of Lactobacillus paracasei CT12 Isolated from Water Kefir Grains 
      (Tibicos).
PG  - 2584-2592
LID - 10.1007/s00284-020-02016-0 [doi]
AB  - The water kefir grains are a multi-species starter culture used to produce fermented 
      beverages of sucrose solution with or without fruit extracts. The water kefir grains 
      are known in Mexico as Tibicos, which are mainly used to produce Tepache, a 
      traditional Mexican drink made by fermenting pineapple peel. The microbiota of 
      Tibicos mainly include lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and since most probiotics belong 
      to this group, Tibicos may represent a potential source of probiotic bacteria. 
      Moreover, several bacteria isolated from kefir samples have been recognized as 
      probiotics. Hence, the aim of this study was to assess the probiotic properties of a 
      Lactobacillus strain isolated from Tibicos. The isolated, designed as CT12, was 
      identified as Lactobacillus paracasei by sequencing 16S RNA gene. L. paracasei CT12 
      showed a survival rate of ca. 57% and 40% following simulated gastric and intestinal 
      digestion, respectively. Besides, the strain was sensitive to ampicillin and 
      erythromycin, and exhibited hydrophobicity (97-99%), autoaggregation (ca. 70%) and 
      mucin adhesion properties (up to 90%), while no possessed haemolytic capacity. 
      Furthermore, its cell-free supernatant displayed relevant antimicrobial, antifungal 
      and antioxidant capacity. Hence, L. paracasei CT12 appears to possess a potential 
      probiotic value.

LID - 10.1016/j.burns.2011.12.005 [doi]
AB  - Kefirs are natural probiotic compounds with antibacterial and anti-inflammatory 
      properties which were tested in experimental burn injury. Kefir gels were prepared 
      from an extract of continuously cultured kefir grains in MRS Broth medium for 24, 48 
      and 96h. Similar burn injuries were made on dorsal skin surface of 56 rats. After 
      24h the wounds were infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The infected rats were 
      divided in to 7 groups of 8 rats each. The base gel, silver sulfadiazine ointment, 
      kefir 24h gel, kefir 48h gel, kefir 96h gel and kefir grains 96h gel were applied 
      twice a day. Burn wound area was measured at baseline, one and two weeks. After two 
      weeks the animals in all groups were sacrificed and whole skin wound areas were 
      removed and percentage of epithelization, scar formation, inflammation and 
      angiogenesis were evaluated. Results indicated that at the end of the 2nd week the 
      percentage of wound size were lowest in order of kefir 96h gel<kefir grains 96h 
      gel<kefir 48h gel<kefir 24h gel<silver sulfadiazine 1%<untreated and based gel 
      groups. At the end of the 2nd week the percentage of inflammation was lower and 
      percentage of epithelization and scar formation was higher in order of kefir 96h 
      gel, kefir grains 96h gel, kefir 48h gel, kefir 24h gel, silver sulfadiazine 1%, 
      base gel and untreated groups. In conclusion the kefir gel therapy was an effective 
      therapeutic approach to improve outcomes after severe burn as compared to 
      conventional silver sulfadiazine treatment.

TI  - Adsorption Mechanism of Patulin from Apple Juice by Inactivated Lactic Acid Bacteria 
      Isolated from Kefir Grains.
LID - 10.3390/toxins13070434 [doi]
LID - 434
AB  - In the food industry, microbiological safety is a major concern. Mycotoxin patulin 
      represents a potential health hazard, as it is heat-resistant and may develop at any 
      stage during the food chain, especially in apple-based products, leading to severe 
      effects on human health, poor quality products, and profit reductions. The target of 
      the study was to identify and characterize an excellent adsorbent to remove patulin 
      from apple juice efficiently and to assess its adsorption mechanism. To prevent 
      juice fermentation and/or contamination, autoclaving was involved to inactivate 
      bacteria before the adsorption process. The HPLC (high-performance liquid 
      chromatography) outcome proved that all isolated strains from kefir grains could 
      reduce patulin from apple juice. A high removal of 93% was found for juice having a 
      4.6 pH, 15° Brix, and patulin concentration of 100 μg/L by Lactobacillus 
      kefiranofacien, named JKSP109, which was morphologically the smoothest and biggest 
      of all isolates in terms of cell wall volume and surface area characterized by SEM 
      (Scanning electron microscopy) and TEM (transmission electron microscopy). C=O, OH, 
      C-H, and N-O were the main functional groups engaged in patulin adsorption indicated 
      by FTIR (Fourier transform-infrared). E-nose (electronic nose) was performed to 
      evaluate the aroma quality of the juices. PCA (Principal component analysis) results 
      showed that no significant changes occurred between control and treated juice.

AB  - In this work, an advanced analysis of the 3D surface microtexture of the microbial 
      films grown on Kefir loaded with Açaí extract was performed. Atomic force microscopy 
      was used to characterize the 3D surface microtexture data in correlation with the 
      stereometric analyses to allow a better understanding of the surface micromorphology 
      consistent with ISO 25178-2: 2012. Two new parameters, fractal succolarity and 
      fractal lacunarity, have been inserted for a quantitative approach to microtexture. 
      The results revealed that the morphology was affected by the increase of the Açaí 
      concentration in biofilms, as well as the fractal succolarity and lacunarity. 
      Adhesive bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus were observed for the lowest 
      concentrations of Açaí. Moreover, it was found that the surface of the biofilms has 
      shown saturation when the concentration has changed from 4 to 6 % of Açaí. These 
      results are of great interest in the characterization of surfaces with promising 
      application like skin dressing.

AB  - Donkey milk and donkey milk kefir exhibit antiproliferative, antimutagenic and 
      antibacterial effects. We investigated the effects of donkey milk and donkey milk 
      kefir on oxidative stress, apoptosis and proliferation in Ehrlich ascites carcinoma 
      (EAC) in mice. Thirty-four adult male Swiss albino mice were divided into four 
      groups as follows: group 1, administered 0.5 ml water; group 2, administered 0.5 ml 
      water + EAC cells; group 3, administered 0.5 ml donkey milk + EAC cells; group 4, 
      administered 0.5 ml donkey milk kefir + EAC cells. We introduced 2.5 x 10(6) EAC 
      cells into each animal by subcutaneous injection. Tap water, donkey milk and donkey 
      milk kefir were administered by gavage for 10 days. Animals were sacrificed on day 
      11. After measuring the short and long diameters of the tumors, tissues were 
      processed for histology. To determine oxidative stress, cell death and proliferation 
      iNOS and eNOS, active caspase-3 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen were assessed 
      using immunohistochemistry. A TUNEL assay also was used to detect apoptosis. Tumor 
      volume decreased in the donkey milk kefir group compared to the control and donkey 
      milk groups. Tumor volume increased in the donkey milk group compared to the control 
      group. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen levels were higher in the donkey milk 
      kefir group compared to the control and donkey milk groups. The number of apoptotic 
      cells was less in the donkey milk group, compared to the control, whereas it was 
      highest in the donkey milk kefir group. Donkey milk administration increased eNOS 
      levels and decreased iNOS levels, compared to the control group. In the donkey milk 
      kefir group, iNOS levels were significantly lower than those of the control and 
      donkey milk groups, while eNOS levels were similar to the control group. Donkey milk 
      kefir induced apoptosis, suppressed proliferation and decreased co-expression of 
      iNOS and eNOS. Donkey milk promoted development of the tumors. Therefore, donkey 
      milk kefir appears to be more beneficial for treating breast cancer than donkey 
      milk.

AB  - The effect of different types of sugar (sucrose, demerara, brown, fructose, coconut 
      sugar, and honey) on sheep milk kefir was evaluated. Microbial counts 
      (Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, yeast), antagonistic activity against 
      foodborne pathogens, microstructure (scanning electron microscopy), and 
      antiproliferative activity of cancer cells were evaluated. Furthermore, the 
      antioxidant activity (DPPH), inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme 
      (ACE), α-amylase, and α-glucosidase, lactose content, lactic and acetic acids and 
      ethanol, fatty acid profile and volatile organic compounds were determined. The 
      addition of sugars increased the Lactobacillus population (up to 2.24 log CFU/mL), 
      metabolites concentration, antagonistic activity against pathogens, antioxidant 
      activity (11.1 to 24.1%), ACE inhibitory activity (27.5 to 37.6%), α-amylase 
      inhibition (18 to 37.4%), and anti-proliferative activity. Furthermore, it improved 
      the fatty acid profile and volatile compounds. The results suggest that the 
      replacement of sucrose with different types of sugar constitute an interesting 
      option to be used in sheep milk kefir formulations.

TI  - Zooming Into the Microbiota of Home-Made and Industrial Kefir Produced in Greece 
      Using Classical Microbiological and Amplicon-Based Metagenomics Analyses.

AB  - Kefir is a high nutritional fermented dairy beverage associated with a wide range of 
      health benefits. It constitutes a unique symbiotic association, comprising mainly 
      lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, and occasionally acetic acid bacteria, which is 
      strongly influenced by the geographical origin of the grains, the type of milk used, 
      and the manufacture technology applied. Until recently, kefir microbiota has been 
      almost exclusively studied by culture-dependent techniques. However, high-throughput 
      sequencing, alongside omics approaches, has revolutionized the study of food 
      microbial communities. In the present study, the bacterial, and yeast/fungal 
      microbiota of four home-made samples (both grains and drinks), deriving from well 
      spread geographical regions of Greece, and four industrial beverages, was elucidated 
      by culture-dependent and -independent analyses. In all samples, classical 
      microbiological analysis revealed varying populations of LAB and yeasts, ranging 
      from 5.32 to 9.60 log CFU mL(-1) or g(-1), and 2.49 to 7.80 log CFU mL(-1) or g(-1), 
      respectively, while in two industrial samples no yeasts were detected. Listeria 
      monocytogenes, Salmonella spp. and Staphylococcus spp. were absent from all the 
      samples analyzed, whereas Enterobacteriaceae were detected in one of them. From a 
      total of 123 isolates, including 91 bacteria and 32 yeasts, Lentilactobacillus 
      kefiri, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Lactococcus lactis as well as Kluvyeromyces 
      marxianus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were the mostly identified bacterial and 
      yeast species, respectively, in the home-made samples. On the contrary, 
      Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and 
      Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus along with Debaryomyces hansenii and K. marxianus were 
      the main bacterial and yeast species, respectively, isolated from the industrial 
      beverages. In agreement with the identification results obtained from the 
      culture-dependent approaches, amplicon-based metagenomics analysis revealed that the 
      most abundant bacterial genera in almost all home-made samples (both grains and 
      drinks) were Lactobacillus and Lactococcus, while Saccharomyces, Kazachstania, and 
      Kluvyeromyces were the predominant yeasts/fungi. On the other hand, Streptococcus, 
      Lactobacillus, and Lactococcus as well as Kluvyeromyces and Debaryomyces dominated 
      the bacterial and yeast/fungal microbiota, respectively, in the industrial 
      beverages. This is the first report on the microbiota of kefir produced in Greece by 
      a holistic approach combining classical microbiological, molecular, and 
      amplicon-based metagenomics analyses.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the protective effects of kefir against myocardial 
      infarction induced by isoproterenol (ISO). The rats were randomly divided into 4 
      groups, each group consisting of 8 rats. The control group, the kefir group (5 
      mL/kg/d kefir administered to rats as intra-gastric gavage for 60 d), the ISO group 
      (100 mg/kg ISO was administered to rats, s.c. on 61. and 62. d), and kefir+ISO group 
      (5 mL/kg/d kefir was administered to rats intra gastric gavage for 60 days prior to 
      ISO, 100 mg/kg in two doses on day 61 and 62). 12 h after the last ISO dose, all 
      rats were decapitated and their blood samples were collected. Cardiac tissue was 
      reserved for histopathological examination. creatine kinase (CK), alanine 
      aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase 
      (LDH), triglycerides, total cholesterol,very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), low 
      density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and glucose were measured 
      by autoanalyzer, whole blood malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH) and plasma 
      advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) levels were measured 
      spectrophotometrically. It was determined that in the group of kefir+ISO, the levels 
      of AST (p<0.001), CK (p<0.001), LDH (p<0.001), MDA (p<0.001) and AOPP (p<0.001) were 
      decreased, while the GSH (p<0.05) increased, compared to ISO group. There were no 
      significant changes in lipid profile and glucose levels between these two groups. In 
      conclusion, by examining cardiac enzymes and histopathological changes in cardiac 
      tissue, it can be concluded that the administration of kefir in myocardial 
      infarction induced by ISO can protect the heart with its antioxidant characteristic 
      and minimize the toxic damage created by ISO.

AB  - Several studies have reported that lactic acid bacteria may increase the production 
      of free fatty acids by lipolysis of milk fat, though no studies have been found in 
      the literature showing the effect of kefir grains on the composition of fatty acids 
      in milk. In this study the influence of kefir grains from different origins [Rio de 
      Janeiro (AR), Viçosa (AV) e Lavras (AD)], different time of storage, and different 
      fat content on the fatty acid content of cow milk after fermentation was 
      investigated. Fatty acid composition was determined by gas chromatography. Values 
      were considered significantly different when p<0.05. The highest palmitic acid 
      content, which is antimutagenic compost, was seen in AV grain (36.6g/100g fatty 
      acids), which may have contributed to increasing the antimutagenic potential in 
      fermented milk. Higher monounsaturated fatty acid (25.8 g/100g fatty acids) and 
      lower saturated fatty acid (72.7 g/100g fatty acids) contents were observed in AV, 
      when compared to other grains, due to higher Δ9-desaturase activity (0.31) that 
      improves the nutritional quality of lipids. Higher oleic acid (25.0 g/100g fatty 
      acids) and monounsaturated fatty acid (28.2g/100g fatty acids) and lower saturated 
      fatty acid (67.2g/100g fatty acids) contents were found in stored kefir relatively 
      to fermented kefir leading to possible increase of antimutagenic and 
      anticarcinogenic potential and improvement of nutritional quality of lipids in 
      storage milk. Only high-lipidic matrix displayed increase polyunsaturated fatty 
      acids after fermentation. These findings open up new areas of study related to 
      optimizing desaturase activity during fermentation in order to obtaining a fermented 
      product with higher nutritional lipid quality.

TI  - Analytical Characterization of the Widely Consumed Commercialized Fermented 
      Beverages from Russia (Kefir and Ryazhenka) and South Africa (Amasi and Mahewu): 
      Potential Functional Properties and Profiles of Volatile Organic Compounds.

AB  - In this study, four commercialized indigenous fermented beverages most highly 
      consumed in Russia (kefir and ryazhenka) and South Africa (amasi and mahewu) were 
      analyzed for their potential health-promoting properties and flavor-forming volatile 
      organic compounds (VOC). The analysis of antioxidant capacity demonstrated 
      superiority of dairy-based beverages (kefir, ryazhenka and amasi) over the 
      corn-based mahewu; however, mahewu outperformed dairy-based beverages in terms of 
      its potential antihypertensive effect (i.e., the ability to inhibit angiotensin I 
      converting enzyme). The fatty acid (FA) content of kefir and ryazhenka were more 
      diverse compared to that of amasi, but included a lesser amount of branched chain 
      FA. In terms of calculated FA nutritional indices (e.g., indices of atherogenicity 
      and thrombogenicity), kefir and ryazhenka performed similarly and significantly 
      better than amasi. The agreement between beverages theoretical flavor profiles, 
      which was obtained based on the flavors of individual VOC, and consumers' flavor 
      perception allow hypothesizing about the contribution of detected VOC to the overall 
      products' flavor. The obtained data expand current knowledge regarding traditional 
      fermented beverages and their values in terms of national dietary recommendations. 
      Additionally, reported VOC profiles will promote the inclusion of traditional 
      fermented beverages into the rations based on the flavor pairing concept (which is 
      controversial but widely applied).

AB  - The role of Tibet kefir milk (TKM) feeding on fat deposition was investigated in 
      high-fat diet (HFD)-fed human flora-associated (HFA) rats. TKM feeding reduced 
      abdominal fat mass from 33.9 g to 24.0 g and serum triglyceride (TG) from 
      0.75 mmol/L to 0.47 mmol/L, and caused lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to decrease from 
      395.8 ± 36.0 ng/L to 362.3 ± 64.4 ng/L in fat and increase from 287.3 ± 40.8 ng/L to 
      329.8 ± 48.5 ng/L and 312.5 ± 22.0 to 375.1 ± 30.8 ng/L in liver and serum, 
      respectively. Likewise, TMK feeding down-regulated Lpl gene expression in fat and 
      Angptl4 (angiopoietin-like protein-4, also known as fasting-induced adipose factor) 
      gene expression in liver, and up-regulated Angptl4 gene expression in fat. Sequence 
      analysis showed that the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes proportion and Verrucomicrobia at 
      the phylum level, Akkermansia, Escherichia and Oscillospira at the genus level, as 
      well as Escherichia coli at the species level were positively regulated by TKM. The 
      results indicated that TKM decreased abdominal fat deposition and serum TG by 
      regulating Lpl and Angptl4 at the transcriptional level. The microbiota groups 
      mentioned above were regulated by TKM at the same time and may be the potential 
      intervention targets to reduce fat deposition.

AB  - SCOPE: The microorganisms that make up kefir grains are well known for lactose 
      fermentation, but the extent to which they hydrolyze and consume milk proteins 
      remains poorly understood. Peptidomics technologies were used to examine the 
      proteolytic activity of kefir grains on bovine milk proteins. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      Gel electrophoresis revealed substantial digestion of milk proteins by kefir grains, 
      with mass spectrometric analysis showing the release of 609 protein fragments and 
      alteration of the abundance of >1500 peptides that derived from 27 milk proteins. 
      Kefir contained 25 peptides identified from the literature as having biological 
      activity, including those with antihypertensive, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, 
      opioid and anti-oxidative functions. 16S rRNA and shotgun metagenomic sequencing 
      identified the principle taxa in the culture as Lactobacillus species. CONCLUSION: 
      The model kefir sample contained thousands of protein fragments released in part by 
      kefir microorganisms and in part by native milk proteases.

      Clostridium difficile in vitro.

AB  - Kefir is a dairy product obtained by fermentation of milk with a complex microbial 
      population and several health-promoting properties have been attributed to its 
      consumption. In this work, we tested the ability of different kefir-isolated 
      bacterial and yeast strains (Lactobacillus kefir, Lb. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis 
      subps. lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces marxianus) or a mixture of 
      them (MM) to antagonise the cytopathic effect of toxins from Clostridium difficile 
      (TcdA and TcdB). Cell detachment assays and F-actin network staining using Vero cell 
      line were performed. Although incubation with microbial cells did not reduce the 
      damage induced by C. difficile spent culture supernatant (SCS), Lc. lactis CIDCA 
      8221 and MM supernatants were able to inhibit the cytotoxicity of SCS to Vero cells. 
      Fraction of Lc. lactis CIDCA 8221 supernatant containing components higher than 10 
      kDa were responsible for the inhibitory activity and heating of this fraction for 15 
      min at 100 °C completely abrogated this ability. By dot-blot assay with anti-TcdA or 
      anti-TcdB antibodies, concentration of both toxins seems to be reduced in SCS 
      treated with Lc. lactis CIDCA 8221 supernatant. However, protective effect was not 
      affected by treatment with proteases or proteases-inhibitors tested. In conclusion, 
      we demonstrated that kefir-isolated Lc. lactis CIDCA 8221 secreted heat-sensitive 
      products able to protect eukaryotic cells from cytopathic effect of C. difficile 
      toxins in vitro. Our findings provide new insights into the probiotic action of 
      microorganisms isolated from kefir against virulence factors from intestinal 
      pathogens.

AB  - Probiotics are incorporated into food products because of numerous favorable effects 
      on human health. The viability of probiotics is often affected by unfavorable 
      interference during processing. The encapsulation can provide protection to 
      probiotics during mechanical processing, storage, and gastrointestinal digestion. 
      This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of whey protein isolate (WPI) and 
      dextran (DX) conjugates for Lactobacillus plantarum. The WPI-DX conjugate was 
      prepared by Maillard-based glycation and confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Extending 
      the heating time from 1 to 5 h decreased the content of tryptophan residues and 
      increased the amide I and amide II bands. The enhanced protective ability of 
      Maillard reaction products (MRPs) for L. plantarum was observed under conditions of 
      stress (pH, heat, and salt) and in vitro digestion. In situ viability tests showed 
      that encapsulation improved the survival of bacteria in kefir during 15 days of 
      storage at 4 °C. Overall, our results provide valuable information for the 
      development of functional probiotic food products.

AB  - Kefir, a probiotic beverage prepared from fermented milk, has been associated with 
      antihypertensive activity. However, the bioactive molecules responsible for this 
      activity still remain unclear. Therefore, in this study we aim to evaluate the 
      mechanisms of the antihypertensive effects of Kefir in the two-kidney one-clip 
      hypertension model, and to bioprospect for bioactive peptides identified by 
      proteomic methodologies. Treatment with Kefir was performed via gavage, and resulted 
      in a 37 mmHg reduction in systolic arterial pressure and 19% inhibition of 
      angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity. For the proteopeptidomic study, the 
      protein extract of Kefir beverage and non-fermented bovine milk were analysed by 
      MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and their tryptic digestion products sequenced via 
      Shotgun proteomics (Q-Exactive mass spectrometer). A list of 35 peptides with 
      potential hypertensive activity due to ACE inhibition were identified. These results 
      demonstrate the benefits of Kefir products, and may guide the design of new 
      antihypertensive drugs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Kefir is obtained by fermentation of milk with complex microbial 
      populations present in kefir grains. Several health-promoting benefits have been 
      attributed to kefir consumption. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to 
      conduct a subchronic toxicity study, offering the rats normal or high-doses of kefir 
      and evaluating growth, hematology and blood chemistry, as well as assessing 
      bacterial translocation and the integrity of the intestinal mucosa of animals. 
      METHODS: Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups (n = 6/group): control 
      group received 0.7 mL of water, kefir group received 0.7 mL/day of kefir, 
      (normodose), and Hkefir group received 3.5 mL/day of kefir (fivefold higher dose). 
      Feeding was carried out by gavage. The animals were housed in individual cages and 
      maintained under standard conditions for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The normodose and 
      high-dose of kefir supplementation did not harm the animals since growth, hematology 
      and blood chemistry in rats, as well as the potential pathogenicity in tissues were 
      within normal limits, demonstrating that consumption of normodose and highdose of 
      kefir are safe. In addition, administration of the normodose of kefir reduced 
      cholesterol levels and improved the intestinal mucosa of the rats. CONCLUSION: These 
      results demonstrate that the consumption of kefir is safe. Importantly, while 
      damages are not seen for the high-dose, the normodose consumption is recommended due 
      to the pronounced beneficial effects, as safety is concerned.

AB  - We investigated the potential influence of kefir-induced juglone and resveratrol 
      fractions (JRK) against Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) bearing BALB/c male mice. 
      Kefir yeast was grown in the cell culture supplemented with juglone and resveratrol 
      (1:2). After 48 h incubation, JRK solution was applied (0.1 mL/day i.p.) to the 
      EAC-bearing mice throughout five days. Molecular regulatory mechanisms of apoptotic 
      and anti-apoptotic pathway components were evaluated in the plasma of mice and 
      isolated EAC cells with ELISA, qRT-PCR, and immunocytchemical experiments. 
      EAC-induced upregulation in Bcl-2 and downregulation in Caspase-3 were normalized 
      with JRK in the plasma of mice. Additionally, JRK upregulated the expression levels 
      of apoptotic Bax, p53, Caspase-3,8,9, and APAF-1 proteins together with BAX, 
      CASPASE-8, and CASPASE-9 genes in isolated EAC cells. These changes were also 
      associated with decreased expression levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl 
      proteins. Immunocytochemical studies also confirmed the activation of apoptotic 
      pathways and repression of anti-apoptotic proteins in EAC cells with JRK treatment. 
      JRK activates apoptotic pathway and inhibits anti-apoptotic genes and proteins in 
      Ehrlich ascites carcinoma- bearing BALB/c mice that could be beneficial in cancer 
      treatment.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of kefir culture entrapped in 
      casein and in whey protein as starter cultures for the production of Feta-type 
      cheese. Microbiological analysis showed that counts of enterobacteria, coliforms, 
      and staphylococci were significantly reduced due to kefir culture. In addition, the 
      effect of kefir culture on the formation of volatile compounds, such as esters, 
      organic acids, alcohols, carbonyl compounds, and lactones, was also investigated 
      using the SPME GC/MS technique. Cheese samples produced with kefir culture entrapped 
      in milk proteins presented improved profile of aroma-related compounds. Principal 
      component analysis of the results indicated that the volatile composition of the 
      different cheese types was dependent on the nature of the starter culture. Finally, 
      the sensory evaluation showed that the products produced with kefir culture had a 
      soft, fine taste, and were of improved quality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The main causes of spinal cord ischemia are a variety of vascular 
      pathologies causing acute arterial occlusions. We investigated neuroprotective 
      effects of kefir on spinal cord ischemia injury in rats. METHODS: Rats were divided 
      into three groups : 1) sham operated control rats; 2) spinal cord ischemia group fed 
      on a standard diet without kefir pretreatment; and 3) spinal cord ischemia group fed 
      on a standard diet plus kefir. Spinal cord ischemia was performed by the infrarenal 
      aorta cross-clamping model. The spinal cord was removed after the procedure. The 
      biochemical and histopathological changes were observed within the samples. 
      Functional assessment was performed for neurological deficit scores. RESULTS: The 
      kefir group was compared with the ischemia group, a significant decrease in 
      malondialdehyde levels was observed (p<0.05). Catalase and superoxide dismutase 
      levels of the kefir group were significantly higher than ischemia group (p<0.05). In 
      histopathological samples, the kefir group is compared with ischemia group, there 
      was a significant decrease in numbers of dead and degenerated neurons (p<0.05). In 
      immunohistochemical staining, hipoxia-inducible factor-1α and caspase 3 
      immunopositive neurons were significantly decreased in kefir group compared with 
      ischemia group (p<0.05). The neurological deficit scores of kefir group were 
      significantly higher than ischemia group at 24 h (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Our study 
      revealed that kefir pretreatment in spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion reduced 
      oxidative stress and neuronal degeneration as a neuroprotective agent. 
      Ultrastructural studies are required in order for kefir to be developed as a 
      promising therapeutic agent to be utilized for human spinal cord ischemia in the 
      future.

AB  - Preliminary evidence has suggested that probiotics may improve eradication rates in 
      patients infected with Helicobacter pylori treated by triple therapy. This study 
      examined the effect of combining triple therapy with kefir, a fermented milk drink 
      containing probiotics. A randomized, double-blind study was carried out on 82 
      consecutive patients with symptoms of dyspepsia and H. pylori infection confirmed by 
      the urea breath test. Patients were given a two times a day, 14-day course of 
      lansoprazole (30 mg), amoxicillin (1,000 mg), and clarithromycin (500 mg) with 
      either 250 mL of kefir twice daily (triple therapy + kefir, n = 46) or 250 mL of 
      milk containing placebo (triple therapy + placebo, n = 36). Side effects were 
      determined using a standard questionnaire form at 15 days after beginning treatment. 
      Patients returned for urea breath tests 45 days after beginning treatment. 
      Significantly more triple therapy + kefir patients achieved eradication (36 of 46 
      [78.2%]) compared with triple therapy + placebo patients (18 of 36 [50.0%]) 
      (P = .026, χ(2) test). Side effects were significantly less frequent and less severe 
      in triple therapy + kefir patients than in triple therapy + placebo patients. We 
      conclude that a 14-day regimen of triple therapy with kefir is more effective in 
      achieving H. pylori eradication than is triple therapy alone.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to perform simultaneous alcoholic and malolactic 
      wine fermentations using free or immobilized kefir culture at a wide temperature 
      range (5-45 °C). Repeated batch fermentations were carried out for a period up to 
      29 months, suggesting a high operational stability of the systems, while malic acid 
      conversion and ethanol productivity up to 70.9% and 36.9 g/(Ld) were noted. Volatile 
      acidity was at levels typically found in wines (<1.0 g acetic acid/L) in most cases, 
      although increased values were recorded in wines produced at 5 °C, but no vinegar 
      taint was detected. Fusel alcohols were at levels usually found in wines, but were 
      reduced at 5 °C. Application of PCA to minor volatiles showed that the fermentation 
      temperature rather than the nature of kefir culture had a significant effect. 
      Noticeably, all products were accepted by the panel during the preliminary sensory 
      evaluation.

AB  - Kefir is a probiotic fermented milk product produced from grains with a complex 
      composition of bacteria and yeasts that live in a symbiotic association. 
      Anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-mutagenic effects are some of the 
      health beneficial properties of kefir grains. The present study was conducted to 
      evaluate whether regular consumption of kefir milk would be capable of preventing 
      the development of pre-neoplastic lesions induced by azoxymethane (AOM). Aberrant 
      crypt foci were induced in BALB-c mice via 2 subcutaneous injections of azoxymethane 
      (15 mg/kg) and kefir was administered by daily gavage for 8 weeks (5 ml/kg). 
      Additionally, bacterial growth was monitored in pasteurized and ultra-high 
      temperature (UHT) treated milk to compare different fermentation conditions. Our 
      results showed that UHT milk presented better growth of Lactobacillus acidophilus 
      colonies. The aberrant crypt foci were attenuated by approximately 43% (height) and 
      20% (width) in the kefir group compared to AOM group, suggesting that kefir 
      treatment may contribute to prevent and control the growth of intestinal neoplastic 
      cells.

PG  - 1118-1131
LID - 10.1007/s12010-018-2718-2 [doi]
AB  - Kefir, a combined consortium of bacteria and yeast encapsulated by a polymeric 
      matrix of exopolysaccharides, was used as anodic biocatalyst in a two-chamber 
      microbial fuel cell (MFC). Fermentation was followed during 72 h and polarization 
      curves were obtained from linear sweep voltammetry. The effect of methylene blue as 
      charge-transfer mediator in the kefir metabolism was evaluated. UV/Vis 
      spectrophotometry and cyclic voltammetry were applied to evaluate the redox state of 
      the mediator and to characterize the electrochemical activity, whereas current 
      interruption was used for internal resistance determination. Aiming to establish a 
      relationship between the microbial development inside the anodic chamber with the 
      generated power in the MFC, total titratable acidity, pH, viscosity, carbohydrate 
      assimilation, and microbial counting were assayed. The kefir-based MFC demonstrated 
      a maximum power density of 54 mW m(-2) after 24 h fermentation, revealing the 
      potential use of kefir as a biocatalyst for microbial fuel cells.

TI  - Effect of fat replacers on kefir quality.
PG  - 543-8
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.3855 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of fat replacers on the 
      quality of non-fat kefir. Skim milk fortified with Dairy Lo (DL) and inulin (INU) 
      was fermented with kefir grains to manufacture kefir. The results of compositional, 
      microbiological, rheological and sensorial analyses were compared with whole kefir 
      (WK) and non-fat kefir (NFK) controls. Results for dry matter, pH and lactic acid 
      ranged between 82.4 and 109.1 g kg(-1), 4.26 and 4.40, and 7.0 and 9.2 g L(-1), 
      respectively. Acetaldehyde and ethanol contents of samples were between 2.89 and 
      7.28 mg L(-1), and 151.46 and 323.89 mg L(-1), respectively. In all samples, 
      Lactobacillus spp., Streptococcus spp. and yeast counts were between 9.1 and 9.9, 
      9.3 and 9.9, and 5.2 and 5.6 log cfu mL(-1), respectively. Kefir samples had 
      non-Newtonian behaviour and pseudoplastic fluid with thixotropy. At the first day, 
      DL had the highest apparent viscosity (3.119 Pa s) while NFK had the lowest value 
      (1.830 Pa s). In the sensory evaluation, odour and taste scores of samples were not 
      different. Dairy Lo and inulin could be used without any adverse effect for the 
      production of non-fat kefir.

TI  - Effects of Kefir on the Cardiac Autonomic Tones and Baroreflex Sensitivity in 
      Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats.

AB  - AIMS: It has been previously shown that the probiotic kefir (a symbiotic matrix 
      containing acid bacteria and yeasts) attenuated the hypertension and the endothelial 
      dysfunction in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In the present study, the 
      effect of chronic administration of kefir on the cardiac autonomic control of heart 
      rate (HR) and baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) in SHR was evaluated. METHODS: SHR were 
      treated with kefir (0.3 mL/100 g body weight) for 60 days and compared with 
      non-treated SHR and with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. Cardiac autonomic vagal 
      (VT) and sympathetic (ST) tones were estimated through the blockade of the cardiac 
      muscarinic receptors (methylatropine) and the blockade of β1-adrenoceptor 
      (atenolol). The BRS was evaluated by the tachycardia and bradycardia responses to 
      vasoactive drug-induced decreases and increases in arterial blood pressure (BP), 
      respectively. Additionally, spontaneous BRS was estimated by autoregressive spectral 
      analysis. RESULTS: Kefir-treated SHR exhibited significant attenuation of basal BP, 
      HR, and cardiac hypertrophy compared to non-treated SHR (12, 13, and 21%, 
      respectively). Cardiac VT and ST were significantly altered in the SHR (~40 and ~90 
      bpm) compared with Wistar rats (~120 and ~30 bpm) and were partially recovered in 
      SHR-kefir (~90 and ~25 bpm). SHR exhibited an impaired bradycardic BRS (~50%) 
      compared with Wistar rats, which was reduced to ~40% in the kefir-treated SHR and 
      abolished by methylatropine in all groups. SHR also exhibited a significant 
      impairment of the tachycardic BRS (~23%) compared with Wistar rats and this 
      difference was reduced to 8% in the SHR-kefir. Under the action of atenolol the 
      residual reflex tachycardia was smaller in SHR than in Wistar rats and kefir 
      attenuated this abnormality. Spectral analysis revealed increased low frequency 
      components of BP (~3.5-fold) and pulse interval (~2-fold) compared with Wistar rats 
      and these differences were reduced by kefir-treatment to ~1.6- and ~1.5-fold, 
      respectively. Spectral analysis also showed an impairment of spontaneous BRS in SHR, 
      but kefir-treatment caused only a tendency to reverse this result. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      novelty of this study is that daily chronic consumption of a low dose of kefir 
      reduced the impairment of the cardiac autonomic control of HR and of the impaired 
      BRS in SHR.

AB  - Kefir is a fermented milk product that is a good source of protein and 
      health-promoting bacteria. It has the potential to improve recovery from exercise 
      and the health and well-being of cancer survivors. The purpose of this study was to 
      explore cancer survivor attitudes about and acceptance of a kefir recovery beverage 
      made from cultured milk, whole fruit, natural sweeteners, and other natural 
      ingredients. Kefir was made by inoculating and fermenting milk with kefir grains. 
      The kefir was then mixed with a fruit base and given to cancer survivors (n = 52) 
      following a bout of exercise. Participants evaluated the acceptability of the 
      beverage samples (overall appearance, aroma, taste, mouthfeel, and overall liking) 
      using a 9-point hedonic scale, and they evaluated the smoothness using a 3-category 
      just-about-right scale (not enough, just about right, and too much). They also 
      expressed their physical and psychological feelings about the beverage using a 
      5-point scale (1 = not at all to 5 = extremely) and indicated their purchase intent 
      using a binomial (yes/no) response. The health benefits of kefir were then 
      explained, and participants sampled a second beverage (the same product), answering 
      the same questions related to overall liking, feeling, and intent to purchase. We 
      used a paired Student's t-test to compare beverage liking and emotion scores before 
      and after participants learned about the health benefits of kefir. Data are 
      presented as mean ± standard deviations. The beverage scored significantly higher 
      for overall liking after the health benefits were explained (6.5 ± 1.8 and 7.0 ± 1.7 
      out of 9 before and after the explanation of health benefits, respectively). 
      Participants showed a high intent to purchase before they learned about the health 
      benefits (75% of participants indicated an intent to purchase, and 89% after they 
      learned about the health benefits). The beverage received high scores overall and, 
      except for an improvement in overall liking, we observed no significant differences 
      in physical and psychological feelings before and after participants learned that it 
      contained kefir and had potential health benefits. We found the beverage to be 
      acceptable for consumption by cancer survivors, and the majority of participants 
      showed an interest in purchasing for after exercise.

TI  - Kefir Supplementation Modifies Gut Microbiota Composition, Reduces Physical Fatigue, 
      and Improves Exercise Performance in Mice.
LID - 10.3390/nu10070862 [doi]
LID - 862
AB  - The present study evaluated the potential beneficial effect of kefir (KF) against 
      fatigue. Furthermore, the composition of the gut microbiota is related to health 
      benefits in the host; therefore, the study also investigated the effect of KF on the 
      gut microbiota composition. Male ICR mice from four groups (n = 8 per group) were 
      orally administered KF once daily for four weeks at 0, 2.15, 4.31, and 10.76 
      g/kg/day and were designated as the vehicle, KF-1X, KF-2X, and KF-5X groups, 
      respectively. The gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The 
      results showed a significant clustering of cecum after treatment in the vehicle, 
      KF-1X, KF-2X, and KF-5X groups. The KF-2X and KF-5X groups showed a decreased 
      Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio compared with the vehicle group. In addition, 
      anti-fatigue activity and exercise performance were evaluated on the basis of 
      exhaustive swimming time, forelimb grip strength, and levels of serum lactate, 
      ammonia, glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatine kinase (CK) after a 
      swimming exercise. The exhaustive swimming time for the KF-1X, KF-2X, and KF-5X 
      groups was significantly longer than that for the vehicle group, and the forelimb 
      grip strength of the KF-1X, KF-2X, and KF-5X groups was also significantly higher 
      than that of the vehicle group. KF supplementation also decreased serum lactate, 
      ammonia, BUN, and CK levels after the swimming test. However, tissue glycogen 
      content, an important energy source for exercise, increased significantly with KF 
      supplementation. Thus, KF supplementation can alter the gut microbiota composition, 
      improve performance, and combat physical fatigue.

TI  - Biocontrol of Aspergillus flavus in Ensiled Sorghum by Water Kefir Microorganisms.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms7080253 [doi]
LID - 253
AB  - The capacity of microorganisms from water kefir (WK) to control Aspergillus flavus 
      growth during the aerobic phase of ensiled sorghum grains was determined. Sorghum 
      inoculated with A. flavus was treated with filter-sterilized and non-sterilized 
      water kefir, ensiled, and incubated 7 days at 25 °C. A. flavus growth was quantified 
      by qPCR after incubation. Mold growth was inhibited in the presence of water kefir 
      while no inhibition was observed when filter-sterilized water kefir was applied, 
      demonstrating the relevant role of the microorganisms in the kefir water in the 
      biocontrol process. Fungal and bacterial diversity in treated sorghum mini-silos was 
      analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. Firmicutes was the predominant bacterial 
      phyla and Lactobacillus represented the most abundant genus, while Ascomycota was 
      the predominant fungal phyla with Saccharomyces and Pichia as the major genera. 
      Bacterial and yeast counts before and after incubation indicated that the microbial 
      community obtained from WK was able to grow in the sorghum mini-silos in the 
      presence of A. flavus. Results of the present work indicate that the use of a mixed 
      inoculum of microorganisms present in WK may represent an alternative management 
      practice to avoid the growth of A. flavus in ensiled sorghum grains and the 
      concomitant contamination with aflatoxins.

AB  - The association of kefir microbiota was observed by electron microscopic 
      examination. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) observations revealed that kefir 
      grain surface is very rough and the inner portions had scattered irregular holes on 
      its surface. The interior of the grain comprised fibrillar materials which were 
      interpreted as protein, lipid and a soluble polysaccharide, the kefiran complex that 
      surrounds yeast and bacteria in the grain. Yeast was observed more clearly than 
      bacteria on the outer portion of the grain. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) 
      observations of kefir revealed that the grain comprised a mixed culture of yeast and 
      bacteria growing in close association with each other. Microbiota is dominated by 
      budded and long-flattened yeast cells growing together with lactobacilli and 
      lactococci bacteria. Bacterial cells with rounded ends were also observed in this 
      mixed culture. Kefir grains, kefir suspensions, and kefiran were tested for 
      antimicrobial activities against several bacterial and fungal species. The highest 
      activity was obtained against Streptococcus faecalis KR6 and Fusarium graminearum 
      CZ1. Growth of Aspergillus flavus AH3 producing for aflatoxin B1 for 10 days in 
      broth medium supplemented with varying concentrations of kefir filtrate (%, v/v) 
      showed that sporulation was completely inhibited at the higher concentrations of 
      kefir filtrate (7-10%, v/v). The average values of both mycelial dry weights and 
      aflatoxin B1 were completely inhibited at 10% (v/v). This is the first in vitro 
      study about the antifungal characteristics of kefir against filamentous fungi which 
      was manifested by applying its inhibitory effect on the productivity of aflatoxin B1 
      by A. flavus AH3.

AB  - Physiological properties of water-soluble exopolysaccharides (EPS) and residues 
      after EPS removal (Res) from the probiotic kefir were determined in high-fat (HF) 
      diet-fed C57BL/6J mice. EPS solutions showed rheological properties and lower 
      viscosity compared to those of β-glucan (BG). EPS significantly suppressed the 
      adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in a dose-dependent manner. Mice were fed HF 
      diets containing 5% EPS, 5% BG, 8% Res, or 5% microcrystalline cellulose (control) 
      for 4 weeks. Compared with the control, EPS supplementation significantly reduced HF 
      diet-induced body weight gain, adipose tissue weight, and plasma very-low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol concentration (P < 0.05). Res and BG significantly reduced 
      body weight gain; however, reduction in adipose tissue weight was not statistically 
      significant, suggesting that the antiobesity effect of EPS occurs due to viscosity 
      and an additional factor. EPS supplementation significantly enhanced abundance of 
      Akkermansia spp. in feces. These data indicate that EPS shows significant 
      antiobesity effects possibly via intestinal microbiota alterations.

TI  - The Antimetastatic and Antiangiogenesis Effects of Kefir Water on Murine Breast 
      Cancer Cells.
PG  - NP53-NP66
AB  - BACKGROUND: Kefir is a unique cultured product that contains beneficial probiotics. 
      Kefir culture from other parts of the world exhibits numerous beneficial qualities 
      such as anti-inflammatory, immunomodulation, and anticancer effects. Nevertheless, 
      kefir cultures from different parts of the world exert different effects because of 
      variation in culture conditions and media. Breast cancer is the leading cancer in 
      women, and metastasis is the major cause of death associated with breast cancer. The 
      antimetastatic and antiangiogenic effects of kefir water made from kefir grains 
      cultured in Malaysia were studied in 4T1 breast cancer cells. METHODS: 4T1 cancer 
      cells were treated with kefir water in vitro to assess its antimigration and 
      anti-invasion effects. BALB/c mice were injected with 4T1 cancer cells and treated 
      orally with kefir water for 28 days. RESULTS: Kefir water was cytotoxic toward 4T1 
      cells at IC(50) (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of 12.5 and 8.33 mg/mL for 
      48 and 72 hours, respectively. A significant reduction in tumor size and weight 
      (0.9132 ± 0.219 g) and a substantial increase in helper T cells (5-fold) and 
      cytotoxic T cells (7-fold) were observed in the kefir water-treated group. 
      Proinflammatory and proangiogenic markers were significantly reduced in the kefir 
      water-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Kefir water inhibited tumor proliferation in vitro 
      and in vivo mainly through cancer cell apoptosis, immunomodulation by stimulating T 
      helper cells and cytotoxic T cells, and anti-inflammatory, antimetastatic, and 
      antiangiogenesis effects. This study brought out the potential of the probiotic 
      beverage kefir water in cancer treatment.

AB  - AIMS: This study investigated the gastroprotective effects and the systemic 
      oxidative status of oral kefir pretreatment in albino mice submitted to acute 
      gastric ulcer induced by indomethacin. MAIN METHODS: Male Swiss mice were divided 
      into three groups (n = 7): Vehicle (0.3 mL of whole milk/100 g body weight, pH 
      adjusted to 5.0), Kefir (0.3 mL of kefir/100 g body weight) and Proton Pump 
      Inhibitor (PPI, 30 mg/kg of lansoprazole), via gavage for 14 days. Animals were 
      fasted for 16 h and treated orally with indomethacin (40 mg/kg). After 6 h the 
      animals were euthanized, the blood samples were obtained and used for the 
      determination of ROS production, oxidation of macromolecules and apoptosis. The 
      stomachs were removed, opened by the greater curvature, and a macroscopic analysis 
      of the gastric lesions was performed. KEY FINDINGS: Our findings demonstrated that 
      the symbiotic kefir significantly alleviated blood oxidative stress by reducing 
      superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl/peroxynitrite radicals, thereby 
      leading to reduced oxidative damage to macromolecules due to a decreased oxidative 
      stress status in induced gastric lesions. These anti-oxidative properties might 
      contribute favorably to the ulcer attenuation in the kefir group. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      Taken together, these findings support a significant role played by the antioxidant 
      actions of kefir in counteracting the gastric damage induced by this cyclooxygenase 
      inhibitor. It is also worthy to mention that, kefir also exerted the 
      gastroprotective property partly by inhibiting oxidative systemic damage. Based on 
      these considerations, it was implied that kefir might be a contributor for the 
      ROS-scavenging effect.

TI  - The Effect of Fermentation with Kefir Grains on the Physicochemical and Antioxidant 
      Properties of Beverages from Blue Lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) Seeds.
LID - 10.3390/molecules25245791 [doi]
LID - 5791
AB  - Plant derived fermented beverages have recently gained consumers' interest, 
      particularly due to their intrinsic functional properties and presence of beneficial 
      microorganisms. Three variants containing 5%, 10%, and 15% (w/w) of sweet blue lupin 
      (Lupinus angustifolius L. cv. "Boregine") seeds were inoculated with kefir grains 
      and incubated at 25 °C for 24 h. After processing, beverages were stored in 
      refrigerated conditions (6 °C) for 21 days. Changes in microbial population, pH, 
      bioactive compounds (polyphenolics, flavonoids, ascorbic acid), reducing sugars, and 
      free amino acids were estimated. Additionally, viscosity, firmness, color, and free 
      radicals scavenging properties were determined. Results showed that lactic acid 
      bacteria as well as yeast were capable of growing well in the lupin matrix without 
      any supplementation. During the process of refrigeration, the viability of the 
      microorganisms was over the recommended minimum level for kefir products. Hydrolysis 
      of polysaccharides as well as increase of free amino acids was observed. As a result 
      of fermentation, the beverages showed excellent DPPH, ABTS(+·), (·)OH, and O(2)(-) 
      radicals scavenging activities with a potential when considering diseases associated 
      with oxidative stress. This beverages could be used as a new, non-dairy vehicle for 
      beneficial microflora consumption, especially by vegans and lactose-intolerant 
      consumers.

AB  - Kefir is a fermented milk with numerous health favors counting restorative 
      properties of bacterial flora, reduction of the symptoms of lactose intolerance, 
      immune system stimulation, cholesterol reduction, as well as anti-mutagenic and 
      anti-tumor properties. Zearalenone (ZEN) is a mycotoxin produced by some Fusarium 
      species. ZEN often occurs as a contaminant in cereal grains and animal feeds. Human 
      exposure occurs by ingestion of mycotoxin-contaminated products and can cause 
      serious health problems. This study aimed to assess the preventive effect of kefir 
      against ZEN toxicity in cultured HCT-116 colorectal carcinoma cells; by the 
      evaluation of cell viability, oxidative stress status and the initiation of 
      apoptotic cell death pathway. Our results demonstrated that ZEN inhibits cell 
      proliferation which was accompanied by an increase in the generation of free 
      radicals as measured by fluorescent 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) and 
      Malondialdehyde (MDA). As an adaptive response to this redox status, we showed an 
      induction of heat shock protein expression (Hsp 70) and an activation of antioxidant 
      enzymes; catalase and Superoxide Dismutase (SOD). Moreover, a loss of mitochondrial 
      membrane potential (Δѱm) was observed. The co-treatment as well as the pre-treatment 
      by kefir showed a reduction of ZEN induced damages for all tested markers. However, 
      the pre-treatment seems to be the most efficient, it prevented almost all ZEN 
      hazards. Consequently, oxidative damage appears to be a key determinant of ZEN 
      induced toxicity in cultured HCT-116 cells. In conclusion, we showed that kefir may 
      better exert its virtue on preventive mode rather than on curative one. By this way, 
      kefir as a beverage with highly antioxidant properties could be relevant 
      particularly with the emergent demand for natural products which may counteract the 
      detrimental effects of oxidative stress and therefore prevent multiple human 
      diseases.

AB  - This study was conducted to determine the effects of fermented milk products and 
      probiotic on performance, carcass characteristics, blood parameters, and gut 
      microbial population in broiler chickens. A total of 480 one-day-old Ross 308 
      broilers were allocated to 30 floor pens in a completely randomized design with six 
      treatments, five replicates, and 16 chicks (eight males and eight females) in each 
      replicate. On the first day, the male and female chicks were weighed and divided by 
      the feather sexing method so that the average body weight of chicks was 
      approximately equal in each pen. Treatments consisted of six groups (including 
      control): group 1 had a basal diet and normal drinking water, group 2 had a basal 
      diet and probiotics (PrimaLac(®)) in drinking water as recommended by the 
      manufacturer, group 3 had a basal diet and 2 % yogurt in drinking water, group 4 had 
      a basal diet and 4 % yogurt in drinking water, group 5 had a basal diet and 2 % 
      kefir in drinking water, and group 6 had a basal diet and 4 % kefir in drinking 
      water. Chemical and microbiological characteristics of kefir and yogurt were 
      measured after each production. The results showed that 4 % kefir, yogurt, and 
      probiotic at the recommend level in water improved body weight gain, feed intake, 
      and feed conversion ratio compared with other groups ( P < 0.05 ). The results 
      indicated that treatment had a significant effect on the carcass yield, intestinal 
      length, thigh yield, and abdominal fat in male and female chickens ( P < 0.05 ). 
      There were no effects on total bacteria population but the lactobacilli and coliform 
      bacteria populations showed increasing and decreasing trends, respectively, with 4 % 
      kefir, yogurt, and probiotic supplementation at 28 and 42 d ( P < 0.05 ). In 
      addition, blood glucose and total protein increased when using a high levels of 
      kefir, yogurt, and probiotic in water, while cholesterol and LDL (low-density 
      lipoprotein) concentrations were lower in 4 % kefir, yogurt, and probiotic at the 
      recommended level. Consequently, the results of this study showed that the use of 
      4 % kefir, yogurt, and probiotic at recommended level in water had beneficial 
      effects on the growth performance, intestinal bacteria population, and blood 
      biochemical parameters in male and female broiler chickens.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Oxidative stress is a key contributor to aging and age-related 
      diseases. In the present study, we examine the protective effects of PFT, a novel 
      kefir product, against age-associated oxidative stress using aged (10-month-old) 
      mice. METHODS: Mice were treated with PFT orally at a daily dose of 2 mg/kg body 
      weight over 6 weeks, and antioxidant status, protein oxidation, and lipid 
      peroxidation were studied in the brain, liver, and blood. RESULTS: PFT 
      supplementation significantly reduced the oxidative stress biomarkers 
      malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide; reversed the reductions in glutathione (GSH) 
      levels, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and anti-hydroxyl radical (AHR) content; 
      enhanced the antioxidant enzyme activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase 
      (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD); inhibited the liver enzyme levels of 
      aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT); significantly 
      reduced triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) 
      levels; and significantly elevated high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. 
      Interestingly, PFT supplementation reversed the oxidative changes associated with 
      aging, thus bringing levels to within the limits of the young control mice in the 
      brain, liver, and blood. We also note that PFT affects the redox homeostasis of 
      young mice and that it is corrected post-treatment with PFT. CONCLUSION: Our 
      findings show the effectiveness of dietary PFT supplementation in modulating 
      age-associated oxidative stress in mice and motivate further studies of PFT's 
      effects in reducing age-associated disorders where free radicals and oxidative 
      stress are the major cause.

AB  - Kefir is a unique fermented dairy product produced by a mixture of lactic acid 
      bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, and yeast. Here, we compared the antimicrobial 
      spectra of four types of kefirs (A, L, M, and S) fermented for 24, 36, 48, or 72 h 
      against eight food-borne pathogens. Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria 
      monocytogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, 
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Cronobacter sakazakii were used as test strains, and 
      antibacterial activity was investigated by the spot on lawn method. The spectra, 
      potencies, and onsets of activity varied according to the type of kefir and the 
      fermentation time. The broadest and strongest antimicrobial spectrum was obtained 
      after at least 36-48 h of fermentation for all kefirs, although the traditional 
      fermentation method of kefir is for 18-24 h at 25℃. For kefir A, B. cereus, E. coli, 
      S. Enteritidis, P. aeruginosa, and C. sakazakii were inhibited, while B. cereus, S. 
      aureus, E. coli, S. Enteritidis, P. aeruginosa, and C. sakazakii were inhibited to 
      different extents by kefirs L, M, and S. Remarkably, S. aureus, S. Enteritidis, and 
      C. sakazakii were only inhibited by kefirs L, M, and S, and L. monocytogenes by 
      kefir M after fermentation for specific times, suggesting that the antimicrobial 
      activity is attributable not only to a low pH but also to antimicrobial substances 
      secreted during the fermentation.

TI  - Kefir milk enhances intestinal immunity in young but not old rats.
PG  - 807-12
AB  - The adjuvant effect of kefir fermented milk on the mucosal and systemic immune 
      systems was examined in young (6 mo old) and old (26 mo old) rats. Kefir-fed rats 
      consisted of young or old rats consuming kefir-fermented milk ad libitum on a daily 
      basis in addition to the standard diet, for 28 d. Control rats consumed only the 
      standard diet. The rats were immunized intraduodenally with cholera toxin (CT) on d 
      7 and 21 and killed on d 28. The nonspecific serum immunoglobulin (Ig)A titers in 
      kefir-fed and control rats did not differ in either age group. The serum anti-CT IgA 
      antibody concentrations were significantly higher in the kefir-fed young rats 
      compared with their age-matched controls (+86%, P: < or = 0.05). This difference was 
      associated with enhanced in vitro antibody secretion by cultured lymphocytes 
      isolated from the Peyer's patches and the intestinal lamina propria (+180%, P: < or 
      = 0.05). These enhanced responses were found only in the young rats. However, the 
      nonspecific serum IgG titer was higher (>120%, P: < or = 0.05) and the anti-CT IgG 
      titer was lower (-80%, P: < or = 0.05), in both young and old kefir-fed rats 
      compared with their respective controls. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate 
      that a kefir-supplemented diet affects the intestinal mucosal and systemic immune 
      responses to intraduodenal CT differently in young and old rats. Most importantly, 
      our data suggest that orally administered kefir enhances the specific intestinal 
      mucosal immune response against CT in young adult, but not in senescent rats.

AB  - Water kefir is a traditional fermented beverage made from sucrose, water, kefir 
      granules, dried or fresh fruits. In our water kefir granules, Lactobacillus (L.) 
      hordei is one of the predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) species of this presumed 
      symbiotic consortium. It faces abundant sucrose versus limitation of amino- and 
      fatty acids in an acidic environment. Sequencing of the genome of L. hordei TMW 
      1.1822 revealed one chromosome plus three plasmids. The size of the chromosome was 
      2.42 Mbp with a GC content of 35% GC and 2461 predicted coding sequences. 
      Furthermore, we identified 1474 proteins upon growth on water kefir medium. 
      Metabolic prediction revealed all enzymes required for the glycolytic 
      Embden-Meyerhof (EMP) and phosphoketolase (PKP) pathways. Genes encoding all enzymes 
      involved in citrate, pyruvate and mannitol metabolism are present. Moreover, it was 
      confirmed that L. hordei is prototrophic for 11 amino acids and auxotrophic for 6 
      amino acids when combining putative biosynthesis pathways for amino acids with 
      physiological characterization. Still, for glycine, serine and methionine no sure 
      auxotype could be determined. The OppABCDF peptide transport system is complete, and 
      13 genes encoding peptidases are present. The arginine deiminase system, was 
      predicted to be complete except for carbamate kinase, thus enabling neutralization 
      reactions via ammonium formation but no additional energy generation. Taken together 
      our findings enable prediction of the L. hordei lifestyle in water kefir: Abundant 
      sucrose is consumed directly via parallel EMP and PK pathways and is also 
      extracellularly converted to dextran and fructose by a glucansucrase, leaving 
      fructose as additional carbon source. Essential amino acids (in the form of 
      peptides) and citrate are acquired from fruits. In the lack of FabB unsaturated 
      fatty acids are synthesized by predicted alternative enzymes. Formation of acetoin 
      and diacetyl as well as arginine conversion reactions enable acidification 
      limitation. Other members of the water kefir consortium (yeasts, acetic acid 
      bacteria) likely facilitate or support growth of L. hordei by delivering gluconate, 
      mannitol, amino- and fatty acids and vitamins.

TI  - Kefir extracts suppress in vitro proliferation of estrogen-dependent human breast 
      cancer cells but not normal mammary epithelial cells.
PG  - 416-22
AB  - Anti-tumorigenic effects have been demonstrated in animal studies from the intake of 
      kefir, a traditional fermented milk product believed to originate from the Caucasian 
      mountains of Russia. In the present study, the antiproliferative effects of extracts 
      of kefir, yogurt, and pasteurized cow's milk on human mammary cancer cells (MCF-7) 
      and normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) was investigated at doses of 
      0.31%, 0.63%, 1.25%, 2.5%, 5%, and 10% (vol/vol). After 6 days of culture, extracts 
      of kefir-fermented milk depressed MCF-7 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, 
      showing 29% inhibition of proliferation at a concentration as low as 0.63%, whereas 
      yogurt extracts began to show dose-dependent antiproliferative effects only at the 
      2.5% dose. Moreover, at the 2.5% dose, kefir extracts decreased the MCF-7 cell 
      numbers by 56%, while yogurt extracts decreased MCF-7 cell proliferation by only 
      14%. No antiproliferative effects of kefir extracts were observed in the HMECs, 
      while the yogurt extracts exerted antiproliferative effects on HMECs at the 5% and 
      10% doses. Unfermented milk extracts stimulated proliferation of MCF-7 cells and 
      HMECs at concentrations above 0.31%. Peptide content and capillary electrophoresis 
      analyses showed that kefir-mediated milk fermentation led to an increase in peptide 
      concentrations and a change in peptide profiles relative to milk or yogurt. The 
      present findings suggest that kefir extracts contain constituents that specifically 
      inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cells, which might eventually be useful in 
      the prevention or treatment of breast cancer.

TI  - Kefir improves lactose digestion and tolerance in adults with lactose maldigestion.
PG  - 582-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Kefir is a fermented milk beverage that contains different cultures than 
      yogurt. The objective of this study was to determine whether kefir improves lactose 
      digestion and tolerance in adults with lactose maldigestion. DESIGN: Randomized 
      block design. SUBJECTS: Fifteen healthy, free-living adults with lactose 
      maldigestion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Breath hydrogen excretion and lactose 
      intolerance symptoms were monitored hourly for 8 hours after each test meal. 
      INTERVENTION: Subjects were fed test meals consisting of 20 g lactose portions of 
      milk (2% reduced fat), plain and raspberry flavored kefir, and plain and raspberry 
      flavored yogurt, each following an overnight (12 hour) fast. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: 
      Mixed model ANOVA was performed on raw or transformed data, followed by Tukey HSD 
      post hoc tests (when appropriate). Significance was defined as P<.05. RESULTS: The 
      breath hydrogen area under the curve (AUC) for milk (224+/-39 ppm x h) was 
      significantly greater than for the plain yogurt (76+/-14 ppm x h, P<.001), the plain 
      kefir (87+/-37 ppm x h, P<.001), and the flavored yogurt (76+/-14 ppm x h, P=.005). 
      The flavored kefir had an intermediate response (156+/-26 ppm x h). The yogurts and 
      kefirs all similarly reduced the perceived severity of flatulence by 54% to 71% 
      relative to milk. Abdominal pain and diarrhea symptoms were negligible among the 
      five treatments. APPLICATIONS/CONCLUSION: Because kefir improved lactose digestion 
      and tolerance in this study, its use may be another potential strategy for 
      overcoming lactose intolerance. Further studies of other types of kefir for 
      improving lactose digestion are warranted.

TI  - Chronic administration of the probiotic kefir improves the endothelial function in 
      spontaneously hypertensive rats.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The beverage obtained by fermentation of milk with kefir grains, a 
      complex matrix containing acid bacteria and yeasts, has been shown to have 
      beneficial effects in various diseases. However, its effects on hypertension and 
      endothelial dysfunction are not yet clear. In this study, we evaluated the effects 
      of kefir on endothelial cells and vascular responsiveness in spontaneously 
      hypertensive rats (SHR). METHODS: SHR were treated with kefir (0.3 mL/100 g body 
      weight) for 7, 15, 30 and 60 days and compared with non-treated SHR and with 
      normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats. Vascular endothelial function was evaluated in 
      aortic rings through the relaxation response to acetylcholine (ACh). The balance 
      between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) synthase was evaluated 
      through specific blockers in the ACh-induced responses and through flow cytometry in 
      vascular tissue. RESULTS: Significant effects of kefir were observed only after 
      treatment for 60 days. The high blood pressure and tachycardia exhibited by the SHR 
      were attenuated by approximately 15 % in the SHR-kefir group. The impaired 
      ACh-induced relaxation of the aortic rings observed in the SHR (37 ± 4 %, compared 
      to the Wistar rats: 74 ± 5 %), was significantly attenuated in the SHR group 
      chronically treated with kefir (52 ± 4 %). The difference in the area under the 
      curve between before and after the NADPH oxidase blockade or NO synthase blockade of 
      aortic rings from SHR were of approximately +90 and -60 %, respectively, when 
      compared with Wistar rats. In the aortic rings from the SHR-kefir group, these 
      values were reduced to +50 and -40 %, respectively. Flow cytometric analysis of 
      aortic endothelial cells revealed increased ROS production and decreased NO 
      bioavailability in the SHR, which were significantly attenuated by the treatment 
      with kefir. Scanning electronic microscopy showed vascular endothelial surface 
      injury in SHR, which was partially protected following administration of kefir for 
      60 days. In addition, the recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells was decreased 
      in the non-treated SHR and partially restored by kefir treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Kefir 
      treatment for 60 days was able to improve the endothelial function in SHR by 
      partially restoring the ROS/NO imbalance and the endothelial architecture due to 
      endothelial progenitor cells recruitment.

TI  - Yeasts and Bacterial Consortia from Kefir Grains Are Effective Biocontrol Agents of 
      Postharvest Diseases of Fruits.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8030428 [doi]
LID - 428
AB  - Fungal pathogens in fruits and vegetables cause significant losses during handling, 
      transportation, and storage. Biological control with microbial antagonists replacing 
      the use of chemical fungicides is a major approach in postharvest disease control, 
      and several products based on single antagonists have been developed but have 
      limitations related to reduced and inconsistent performance under commercial 
      conditions. One possible approach to enhance the biocontrol efficacy is to broaden 
      the spectrum of the antagonistic action by employing compatible microbial consortia. 
      Here, we explore commercial kefir grains, a natural probiotic microbial consortium, 
      by culture-dependent and metagenomic approaches and observed a rich diversity of 
      co-existing yeasts and bacterial population. We report effective inhibition of the 
      postharvest pathogen Penicillium expansum on apple by using the grains in its fresh 
      commercial and milk-activated forms. We observed few candidate bacteria and yeasts 
      from the kefir grains that grew together over successive enrichment cycles, and 
      these mixed fermentation cultures showed enhanced biocontrol activities as compared 
      to the fresh commercial or milk-activated grains. We also report several individual 
      species of bacteria and yeasts with biocontrol activities against Penicillium rots 
      on apple and grapefruit. These species with antagonistic properties could be further 
      exploited to develop a synthetic consortium to achieve enhanced antagonistic effects 
      against a wide range of postharvest pathogens.

AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests health-promoting effects of kefir consumption on 
      different nonruminant species, leading to the speculation that kefir may act as a 
      probiotic and benefit calf performance and health. Our objectives were to determine 
      effects of feeding kefir on performance and health of calves in the first 70d of 
      life. Thirty 3-d-old female Holstein calves (body weight=38.2±3.1kg) were blocked by 
      initial body weight and assigned randomly to 1 of 3 treatments (1 calf per pen; 10 
      pens per treatment). Kefir was added to whole milk (vol/vol) at 0:1 (control; KF0), 
      1:3 (KF1), or 1:1 (KF2) and fed twice per day (0800 and 1600h) from d3 through 45 
      and then once per day until weaning, which occurred on d50. Pre- and postweaning 
      intake of starter, daily body weight gain, and gain-to-feed ratio exhibited no 
      difference among treatments. Adding kefir to whole milk fed directly to calves had 
      no effect on concentration of blood metabolites collected on d20, 40, and 70. Body 
      length on d50 (weaning) and 70 was greater in kefir-fed calves. Kefir intake 
      improved fecal scores and reduced days with diarrhea during the first 2wk of life. 
      Apparent digestibility of organic matter, ether extract, crude protein, and neutral 
      detergent fiber remained unaffected by treatment. Overall, it appears that directly 
      feeding kefir to calves during the preweaning period did not improve the performance 
      of calves under the conditions of the current study; however, its consumption 
      marginally improved body length and fecal consistency in the first weeks of life, 
      which is an important concern in intensive calf-rearing systems. Feeding kefir to 
      neonatal calves may be a viable approach to improve the health of calves in 
      commercial calf-rearing operations, although to validate its health-promoting 
      effects additional research is needed to investigate its effects under different 
      calf-rearing conditions.

AB  - Many studies have linked the antimicrobial properties of kefir with the presence of 
      bacteriocins and organic acids. In the present work, results obtained from 
      bacteriostatic and bactericidal studies, and from RP-HPLC, Mass Spectrometry and 
      proton NMR analysis, show that a sample of milk kefir grains is able to produce an 
      antimicrobial fraction, denoted FK-1000, composed of sugars and amino acids, 
      predominantly polymers of alanine, doublets of tyrosine and phenylalanine. Since 
      this fraction is a lyophilized product whose molecular profile is different from 
      bacteriocins and simple carboxylic acids, its antimicrobial effect cannot be 
      attributed to these molecules, or to alcohols or hydrogen peroxide. The fraction is 
      bactericidal against weak-acid-resistant MRSA and weak-acid resistant P. aeruginosa 
      at pH 5, and is bacteriostatic against both pathogens at pH 7. In combination 
      formulation, the FK-1000 fraction is able to increase fivefold the effect of 
      streptomycin against P. aeruginosa and it is not toxic to human epithelial cells at 
      antimicrobial concentrations. 16 S rRNA microbiota analysis of 
      antimicrobial-producing and non-producing kefir grains demonstrated that they are 
      distinct. In summary, the results indicate that milk kefir grains can produce 
      different classes of molecules with potent antibiotic activity against resistant 
      bacteria.

TI  - Sugary Kefir Strain Lactobacillus mali APS1 Ameliorated Hepatic Steatosis by 
      Regulation of SIRT-1/Nrf-2 and Gut Microbiota in Rats.

AB  - SCOPE: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common disease that is 
      concomitant with obesity, resulting in increased mortality. To date, the efficiency 
      of NAFLD treatment still needs to be improved. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the 
      effect of Lactobacillus mali APS1, which was isolated from sugary kefir, on hepatic 
      steatosis in rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). METHODS AND RESULTS: Sprague Dawley 
      rats were fed a control diet, a HFD with saline, and a HFD with APS1 intervention by 
      gavage daily for 12 weeks. The results showed that APS1 significantly reduced body 
      weight and body weight gain in HFD-fed rats. APS1 reduced hepatic lipid accumulation 
      by regulating SIRT-1/PGC-1α/SREBP-1 expression. Moreover, APS1 increased hepatic 
      antioxidant activity by modulating Nrf-2/HO-1 expression. Notably, APS1 manipulated 
      the gut microbiota, resulting in increasing proportions of the phylum 
      Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes and reducing the abundance of specific NAFLD-associated 
      bacteria. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that APS1 ameliorated hepatic 
      steatosis by modulating lipid metabolism and antioxidant activity via manipulating 
      specific NAFLD-associated gut microbiota in vivo.

AB  - The aim of the present study is to encapsulate structured lipids (SLs) by complex 
      coacervation of gelatin and gum arabic with or without using transglutaminase 
      enzymes and to develop a functional kefir product via the addition of encapsulated 
      SLs in the form of suspension and freeze-dried coacervates. Encapsulated SLs were 
      evaluated for their oxidative stability during 30 days of cold storage. The data 
      showed that coacervate solutions were more sensitive to lipid oxidation compared to 
      freeze-dried capsules. Traditionally produced kefir samples that were fortified with 
      complex coacervation products were stored for 10 days at 4 °C. The pH values of the 
      samples decreased, whereas titratable acidity consistently increased during the 
      storage period. Moreover, an in vitro controlled release study was conducted with a 
      fortified kefir sample containing freeze-dried capsules. According to the results, 
      kefir had no significant matrix effect on oil release from the freeze-dried capsules 
      (p > 0.05).

TI  - Sensory and Physicochemical Characterization of Sourdough Bread Prepared with a 
      Coconut Water Kefir Starter.
LID - 10.3390/foods9091165 [doi]
LID - 1165
AB  - There is a recognized need for formulating functional food products using selected 
      lactic acid bacteria (LAB) starter cultures from various sources such as kefir, 
      yoghurt or kombucha that have health benefits. The principle objective of this study 
      was to investigate the use of a coconut water kefir-based fermentation starter 
      culture using Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus plantarum to develop a 
      sourdough bread. Check-all-that-apply (CATA) sensory profiling was used in this 
      study to evaluate the sensory profile of sourdough breads that varied with culture 
      type, culture concentrations, with and without added yeast, and with fermentation 
      for 18 and 24 h. Based on correspondence analysis (CA) of the CATA results, bread 
      samples with positive sensory attributes were chosen for further physicochemical 
      analysis. Physicochemical analyses (texture, proximate composition, shelf life, 
      carboxylic acid analysis and amino acid analysis) were carried out on breads 
      formulated with starter culture concentrations of 8.30 log CFU/mL of L. fermentum, 
      4.90 log CFU/mL of L. fermentum and 9.60 log CFU/mL of L. plantarum, each fermented 
      for 24 h without baker's yeast. The bread sample that was formulated with a coconut 
      water kefir (CWK) starter culture containing 9.60 log CFU/mL of L. plantarum, 
      without dry yeast and fermented for 24 h, had significantly higher values for almost 
      all amino acids and a lower protein content compared to samples formulated using CWK 
      cultures containing 8.30 log CFU/mL of L. fermentum and 4.90 log CFU/mL of L. 
      fermentum, both without dry yeast and fermented for 24 h. The bread sample 
      formulated with CWK starter culture containing 9.60 log CFU/mL of L. plantarum, 
      without dry yeast and fermented for 24 h, also produced significant quantities of 
      organic acids (pyruvic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid and succinic acid). These 
      changes in the physicochemical properties can improve overall bread quality in terms 
      of flavor, shelf life, texture and nutritional value.

TI  - The benefits of soluble non-bacterial fraction of kefir on blood pressure and 
      cardiac hypertrophy in hypertensive rats are mediated by an increase in baroreflex 
      sensitivity and decrease in angiotensin-converting enzyme activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate whether long-term treatment with the soluble 
      non-bacterial fraction of kefir affects mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac 
      hypertrophy through the modulation of baroreflex sensitivity, ACE activity, and the 
      inflammatory-to-anti-inflammatory cytokine ratio in spontaneously hypertensive rats 
      (SHRs). METHODS: SHRs were treated with the soluble non-bacterial kefir fraction 
      (SHR-kefir) or with kefir vehicle (SHR-soluble fraction of milk). Normotensive 
      control Wistar Kyoto animals received the soluble fraction of milk. All treatments 
      were administered by gavage (0.3 mL/100g/body weight), once daily for eight weeks. 
      At the end, after basal MAP and Heart Rate (HT) measurement, barorreflex sensitivity 
      was evaluated through in bolus administrations of sodium nitroprusside and 
      phenylephrine (AP(50) [arterial pressure 50%], the lower plateau, and HR range were 
      measured). ACE activity and cytokines (TNF-α and IL-10) were evaluated by ELISA. 
      Cardiac hypertrophy was analysed morphometrically. RESULTS: Compared to SHR control, 
      SHR-kefir exhibited a significant decrease in both MAP (SHR: 184 ± 5; SHR-Kefir: 
      142 ± 8 mmHg), and HR (SHR: 360 ± 10; SHR-kefir: 310 ± 14 bpm). The non-bacterial 
      fraction of kefir also reduced cardiac hypertrophy, TNF-α-to-IL10 ratio, and ACE 
      activity in SHRs. SHR-kefir baroreflex sensitivity, resulted in a partial but 
      significant recovery of baroreflex gain, as demonstrated by improvements in AP(50), 
      the lower plateau, and HR range. CONCLUSION: In summary, our results indicate that 
      long-term administration of the non-bacterial fraction of kefir promotes a 
      significant decrease in both MAP and HR, by improving baroreflex, and reduces 
      cardiac hypertrophy in SHRs, likely via ACE inhibition, and reduction of the 
      TNF-α-to-IL10 ratio.

TI  - Protective properties of kefir on burn wounds of mice that were infected with S. 
      aureus, P. auroginasa and E. coli.
PG  - 60-65
AB  - Burns and burn wounds are very sensitive to infections and cause a large amount of 
      death worldwide. Although burn wound is sterile at the beginning, because of the 
      risk factors such as prolonged hospital stay, immune suppression and burn affecting 
      large surface area, colonisation with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      and Escherichia coli occur. For the burn therapy, one of the most important ways is 
      to control bacterial infections. A probiotic fermented milk product kefir has 
      antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, anticancer and various health 
      promoting features. This study aims to examine possible protective properties of 
      kefir which was used on the burn wounds that were infected with S. aureus, P. 
      auroginasa and E. coli.  Swiss albino / Balb-c mice were seperated into four groups: 
      (1) used as control group, (2) second-degree burn model+ burn wounds were infected 
      with P.aeruginosa + S.aureus + E.coli, (3) second-burn wounds were treated with 
      sterile pads dressed with kefir and (4) second-degree burn+burn wounds were infected 
      with P. aeruginosa + S.aureus +E.coli before being treated with sterile pads dressed 
      with kefir. The serum biochemical results verified the histopathological results and 
      our findings showed that kefir is an effective product with cell-protecting 
      properties.

TI  - A new practical approach for the biological treatment of a mixture of cheese whey 
      and white wastewaters using Kefir grains.
PG  - 33127-33139
LID - 10.1007/s11356-020-09549-8 [doi]
AB  - Kefir grains are a microbial consortium of different genera of bacteria and yeasts. 
      In this study, the performance of Tunisian Kefir grains during the biological 
      treatment of a mixture of Gouda cheese whey and white wastewaters (GCW) in ratio 1:1 
      with very high organic matter concentration is investigated. The biological process 
      was evaluated and optimized through the response surface methodology. Under the 
      optimum conditions, Kefir grains concentration of 1.02%, temperature at 36.68 °C, 
      and incubation time of 5.14 days, the removal efficiencies of COD, PO(4)(3-), and 
      NO(3)(-) were 87, 37.48, and 39.5%, respectively. Interestingly, the reusability 
      tests of the grains proved not only their high resistance to harsh environmental 
      conditions but also their great potential for more practical applications. 
      Particularly, different strains were isolated from the grains and identified as 
      Kluyveromyces marxianus, Lactoccocus lactis, Lactobacillus kefiri, and Bacillus spp. 
      using 16S rDNA sequence analysis and rep-PCR fingerprinting. At the biological 
      level, the raw GCW (RGCW) has a negative impact on the Hordeum vulgare both on seed 
      germination, and on the growth parameters of seedlings. Interestingly, after Kefir 
      grains treatment, the treated GCW (TGCW) allow a seedlings growth and germination 
      rate similar to those soaked in water.

TI  - Antimutagenic and antioxidant properties of milk-kefir and soymilk-kefir.
PG  - 2467-74
AB  - This study was aimed at evaluating the antimutagenic and antioxidant properties of 
      milk-kefir and soymilk-kefir. Such antimutagenic activity was determined by means of 
      the Salmonella mutagenicity assay, whereas the antioxidant properties of kefir were 
      evaluated by assessing the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging 
      activity, lipid peroxidation inhibition activity, ferrous ion chelating ability, 
      reducing power, and antioxidative enzyme activity. Both milk-kefir and soymilk-kefir 
      demonstrated significantly greater antimutagenic activity than milk and soymilk. 
      Milk-kefir and soymilk-kefir also displayed significantly greater scavenging 
      activity upon DPPH radicals, an inhibition effect upon linoleic acid peroxidation, 
      and more substantial reducing power but displayed a reduced glutathione peroxidase 
      activity than was the case for milk and soymilk. Milk and soymilk fermented by kefir 
      grains did not alter the ferrous ion chelating ability and superoxide dismutase 
      activity of the original materials. These findings have demonstrated that milk-kefir 
      and soymilk-kefir possess significant antimutagenic and antioxidant activity and 
      suggest that milk-kefir and soymilk-kefir may be considered among the more promising 
      food components in terms of preventing mutagenic and oxidative damage.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory properties of kefir and its polysaccharide extract.
PG  - 485-92
AB  - Kefir is a fermented beverage originating form the Caucasian regions composed of a 
      number of bacteria and yeasts living together in polysaccharide grains secreted by 
      them. Kefir can be considered a probiotic source as it presents anti-bacterial, 
      anti-mycotic, anti-neoplasic and immunomodulatory properties. Aiming to appraise a 
      possible anti-inflammatory effect of kefir we conducted cotton-induced granuloma and 
      paw oedema assays in rats, the latter using carrageenan, dextran and histamine as 
      stimuli. Kefir samples were thawed and continuously cultured during 15 days both in 
      a molasses solution (50 g/l) and in cow's milk. A polysaccharide extract isolated 
      from the grains (kefiran) was also tested in cotton-pellet experiments. The results 
      showed significant inhibition in the formation of granuloma tissue for all the test 
      groups, as compared to the blank group. Kefir suspensions in molasses presented an 
      inhibition of 41 +/- 3% for the inflammatory process, fermented milk prepared from 
      kefir showed 44 +/- 6% inhibition and kefiran extract 34 +/- 15%. Rat paw oedema 
      also showed significant decreases with the mediators. Dextran-induced oedema was 
      completely inhibited at 1 h after input, with a 76% inhibition after 2 h. 
      Carrageenan stimulus was inhibited 62% after the 3rd hour, and histamine by 52% 
      after the 2nd hour. These results points to the existence of anti-inflammatory 
      prebiotic compounds present in symbiotic cultures of kefir growing in both aqueous 
      and milky suspensions.

TI  - Short communication: effect of kefir grains on proteolysis of major milk proteins.
PG  - 27-31
LID - 10.3168/jds.2009-2501 [doi]
AB  - The effect of kefir grains on the proteolysis of major milk proteins in milk kefir 
      and in a culture of kefir grains in pasteurized cheese whey was followed by reverse 
      phase-HPLC analysis. The reduction of kappa-, alpha-, and beta-caseins (CN), 
      alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA), and beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG) contents during 48 
      and 90 h of incubation of pasteurized milk (100mL) and respective cheese whey with 
      kefir grains (6 and 12 g) at 20 degrees C was monitored. Significant proteolysis of 
      alpha-LA and kappa-, alpha-, and beta-caseins was observed. The effect of kefir 
      amount (6 and 12 g/100mL) was significant for alpha-LA and alpha- and beta-CN. 
      alpha-Lactalbumin and beta-CN were more easily hydrolyzed than alpha-CN. No 
      significant reduction was observed with respect to beta-LG concentration for 6 and 
      12 g of kefir in 100mL of milk over 48 h, indicating that no significant proteolysis 
      was carried out. Similar results were observed when the experiment was conducted 
      over 90 h. Regarding the cheese whey kefir samples, similar behavior was observed 
      for the proteolysis of alpha-LA and beta-LG: alpha-LA was hydrolyzed between 60 and 
      90% after 12h (for 6 and 12 g of kefir) and no significant beta-LG proteolysis 
      occurred. The proteolytic activity of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in kefir 
      community was evaluated. Kefir milk prepared under normal conditions contained 
      peptides from proteolysis of alpha-LA and kappa-, alpha-, and beta-caseins. 
      Hydrolysis is dependent on the kefir:milk ratio and incubation time. 
      beta-Lactoglobulin is not hydrolyzed even when higher hydrolysis time is used. Kefir 
      grains are not appropriate as adjunct cultures to increase beta-LG digestibility in 
      whey-based or whey-containing foods.

AB  - Recently, a metagenomic study of a water kefir fermentation ecosystem enabled the 
      reconstruction of a metagenome-assembled genome (MAG) of an Oenococcus species that 
      was different from the three species of this genus known so far. Therefore, the name 
      Candidatus Oenococcus aquikefiri was proposed for this novel Oenococcus species. In 
      the meantime, however, a fourth member of the genus, Oenococcus sicerae, isolated 
      from French cider, was reported. The comparison of its genome sequence with the 
      Candidatus O. aquikefiri MAG showed an average nucleotide identity (ANI) value of 
      98.53%. In addition, the 16S rRNA and pheS genes of the two species were 99.4% and 
      99.9% identical, respectively. As the presence of O. sicerae in a water kefir 
      metagenome was also revealed by metagenomic recruitment plotting, it can be stated 
      that Candidatus O. aquikefiri and O. sicerae belong to the same species. 
      Intraspecies variations include the presence or absence of a citrate lyase operon 
      and components of various phosphotransferase (PTS) transport systems.

TI  - Effects of kefir fractions on innate immunity.
PG  - 149-56
AB  - Innate immunity that protects against pathogens in the tissues and circulation is 
      the first line of defense in the immune reaction, where macrophages have a critical 
      role in directing the fate of the infection. We recently demonstrated that kefir 
      modulates the immune response in mice, increasing the number of IgA+ cells in the 
      intestinal and bronchial mucosa and the phagocytic activity of peritoneal and 
      pulmonary macrophages. The aim of this study was to further characterize the 
      immunomodulating capacity of the two fractions of kefir (F1: solids including 
      bacteria and F2: liquid supernatant), by studying the cytokines produced by cells 
      from the innate immune system: peritoneal macrophages and the adherent cells from 
      Peyer's patches. BALB/c mice were fed either kefir solid fraction (F1) or kefir 
      supernatant (F2) for 2, 5 or 7 consecutive days. The number of cytokine (IL-1alpha, 
      IFNgamma, TNFalpha, IL-6 and IL-10) producing cells was determined on peritoneal 
      macrophages and adherent cells from Peyer's patches. Both kefir fractions (F1 and 
      F2) induced similar cytokine profiles on peritoneal macrophages (only TNFalpha and 
      IL-6 were up-regulated). All cytokines studied on adherent cells from Peyer's 
      patches were enhanced after F1 and F2 feeding, except for IFNgamma after F2 
      administration. Moreover, the percentage of IL-10+cells induced by fraction F2 on 
      adherent cells from Peyer's patches was significantly higher than the one induced by 
      fraction F1. Different components of kefir have an in vivo role as oral 
      biotherapeutic substances capable of stimulating immune cells of the innate immune 
      system, to down-regulate the Th2 immune phenotype or to promote cell-mediated immune 
      responses against tumours and also against intracellular pathogenic infections.

TI  - The antiallergic effect of kefir Lactobacilli.
PG  - H244-53
LID - 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01787.x [doi]
AB  - This study demonstrated that oral feeding of heat-inactivated Lactobacillus (L b.) 
      kefiranofaciens M1 from kefir grains effectively inhibited immunoglobulin (Ig) E 
      production in response to ovalbumin (OVA) in vivo. The pattern of cytokine 
      production by splenocyte cells revealed that the levels of cytokines produced by T 
      helper (Th) 1 cells increased, and those of cytokines produced by Th2 cells 
      decreased in the heat-inactivated M1 feeding group. These findings indicated that 
      Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens M1 in the kefir played an important role in 
      antiallergic activities. By additional analysis using flow cytometry and microarray, 
      the mechanism of suppression of IgE production by oral feeding of the 
      heat-inactivated M1 probably occurs because of upregulation of the expression of 
      Cd2, Stat4, and Ifnr leading to skewing the Th1/Th2 balance toward Th1 dominance, 
      elevation of the CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T (Treg) percentage, and reduction of 
      activated CD19(+) B cells. Downregulation of complement system and components was 
      also involved in suppression of IgE production. Practical Application: Kefir has 
      long been considered good for health. Its health benefits include immunoregulatory 
      effects. However, there is a lack of knowledge concerning the immunoregulatory 
      effects induced by kefir lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Our data clearly demonstrated 
      the antiallergic activity of kefir LAB, Lactobacillus (L b.) kefiranofaciens M1. By 
      additional analysis using flow cytometry and microarray, the possible mechanism of 
      suppression of IgE production by oral feeding of the heat-inactivated M1 was also 
      elucidated. Our findings indicated that Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens M1 may have a 
      great potential for utilization in functional food products.

AB  - The aim of this study was to develop a kefir apple-based vinegar and evaluate this 
      fermentation process using new methodology with Biospeckle Laser. Brazilian kefir 
      grains were inoculated in apple must for vinegar production. In this study, the 
      microbial community present in kefir, and correspondent vinegar, was investigated 
      using Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization - Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry 
      (MALDI-TOF MS) technique. Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus paracasei, 
      Lactobacillus plantarum, Acetobacter pasteurianus and Acetobacter syzygii were the 
      microbial species identified. S. cerevisiae, L. plantarum, A. pasteurianus and A. 
      syzygii were found in smaller quantities at the beginning of the alcoholic 
      fermentation, but were found throughout the alcoholic and acetic fermentation. Kefir 
      grains were able to utilize apple must as substrate to produce ethanol, and acetic 
      acid. Acetate, volatile alcohols and aldehydes in the vinegar-based kefir were also 
      produced. The yield of acetic acid in the kefir vinegars was ∼79%. The acetic acid 
      concentration was ∼41gL(-1), reaching the required standard for the Brazilian 
      legislation accepts it as vinegar (4.0% acetic acid). Kefir vinegar showed good 
      acceptance in the sensory analysis. The technology proposed here is novel by the 
      application of immobilized-cell biomass (kefir grains) providing a mixed inocula and 
      eliminating the use of centrifuge at the end of the fermentative process. This step 
      will save energy demand and investment. This is the first study to produce apple 
      vinegar using kefir grains.

TI  - A study on the protective activity of kefir against gastric ulcer.
PG  - 333-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The effect of kefir on peptic ulcer disease was evaluated in an 
      experimental model, with non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, together with the 
      determination of gastric mucus secretion by quantitative digital histochemistry. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The experimental group included 28 male albino Wistar rats. 
      After a diet with standard rat bait for 7 days, 14 rats were fed with kefir for 7 
      days while the others were kept on the same diet. At the 14th day, indomethacin was 
      injected to 7 of the rats fed on kefir and to 7 of the rats on standard rat bait. 
      All the rats were sacrificed after 4 hours. Gastric erosion and ulceration were 
      scored histopathologically. Mucosal mucus was quantified by image analysis, and 
      periodic acid-Schiff stained area percentage was determined. RESULTS: Erosion and 
      ulceration were identified only in cases that received indomethacin. In the cases on 
      kefir, erosion was identified in 6 cases (86%) and ulceration in 1 case. Rats fed on 
      standard diet had erosion in 4 cases (57%) and ulceration in 3 (43%), but the 
      difference was statistically insignificant (Mann-Whitney test, p=0.25). The stained 
      area percentage for gastric mucus was not different between the four groups 
      (Kruskal-Wallis test, p=0.313). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that kefir does 
      not change gastric mucus secretion. Although statistically insignificant, as there 
      were more cases with ulceration in cases on the rat diet, kefir might have a 
      beneficial effect on peptic ulcer disease induced by non-steroid anti-inflammatory 
      drug. This requires further evaluation in larger series.

AB  - The mechanisms responsible for cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases have 
      been the focus of experimental and clinical studies for decades. The relationship 
      between the gut microbiota and the organs and system tissues represents the research 
      field that has generated the highest number of publications. Homeostasis of the gut 
      microbiota is important to the host because it promotes maturation of the autoimmune 
      system, harmonic integrative functions of the brain, and the normal function of 
      organs related to cardiovascular and metabolic systems. On the other hand, when a 
      gut microbiota dysbiosis occurs, the target organs become vulnerable to the onset or 
      aggravation of complex chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular (e.g., arterial 
      hypertension) and neurodegenerative (e.g., dementia) diseases. In the present brief 
      review, we discuss the main mechanisms involved in those disturbances and the 
      promising beneficial effects that have been revealed using functional food 
      (nutraceuticals), such as the traditional probiotic Kefir. Here, we highlight the 
      current scientific advances, concerns, and limitations about the use of this 
      nutraceutical. The focus of our discussion is the endothelial dysfunction that 
      accompanies hypertension and the neurovascular dysfunction that characterizes 
      ageing-related dementia in patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the influence of the water kefir grain inoculum on the 
      characteristics of the water kefir fermentation process. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three 
      water kefir fermentation processes were started with different water kefir grain 
      inocula and followed as a function of time regarding microbial species diversity, 
      community dynamics, substrate consumption profile and metabolite production course. 
      The inoculum determined the water kefir grain growth, the viable counts on the 
      grains, the time until total carbohydrate exhaustion, the final metabolite 
      concentrations and the microbial species diversity. There were always 2-10 lactic 
      acid bacterial cells for every yeast cell and the majority of these micro-organisms 
      was always present on the grains. Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus hilgardii, 
      Lactobacillus nagelii and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were always present and may be 
      the key micro-organisms during water kefir fermentation. Low water kefir grain 
      growth was associated with small grains with high viable counts of micro-organisms, 
      fast fermentation and low pH values, and was not caused by the absence of 
      exopolysaccharide-producing lactic acid bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The water kefir grain 
      inoculum influences the microbial species diversity and characteristics of the 
      fermentation process. A select group of key micro-organisms was always present 
      during fermentation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study allows a 
      rational selection of a water kefir grain inoculum.

AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a novel immobilized system using kefir 
      lactic acid bacteria and sugar cane pieces for the production of fermented milk. 
      Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens HL1, Lactobacillus kefiri HL2, Leuconostoc 
      mesenteroides HL3, and Lactococcus lactis HL4 were isolated from Taiwanese kefir 
      grains and immobilized on pieces of sugar cane using adsorption. Scanning electron 
      micrographs of the cell-immobilized sugar cane pieces (CISCP) showed that the 
      microorganisms were embedded within the porous structures of the sugar cane pieces. 
      During 28 cycles of repeated batch fermentation, viable cells on both sugar cane 
      pieces and fermented products were maintained at 10 log cfu/g (cfu/mL). Random 
      amplified polymorphic DNA PCR analysis revealed that Leu. mesenteroides HL3 (29-43%) 
      and Lc. lactis HL4 (31-49%) were predominant on the CISCP, and the fermented samples 
      had 79% Lc. lactis HL4. When tracking fermentation parameters, the data on the 
      microbial, chemical, and physical properties of the fermented milk suggested that 
      the CISCP had stable fermentative ability over the course of successive 
      fermentations. We found an enhancement of the acid-producing ability of CISCP as the 
      number of fermentations increased, with a significant growth in titratable acidity 
      from 0.65 to 0.81% by the end.

AB  - The main objective of the study was to determine the effects of different 
      fermentation parameters on kefir quality. Kefir samples were produced using kefir 
      grains or natural kefir starter culture, and fermentation was carried out under 
      normal or modified atmosphere (10% CO(2)) conditions. The microbiological 
      (lactobacilli, lactococci, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium spp., and 
      yeasts), chemical (pH, lactic acid, total solids, protein, ethanol, 
      exopolysaccharide contents), rheological, and sensory properties of kefir samples 
      were investigated during a 21-d storage period. The use of different fermentation 
      parameters or the choice of grain versus natural kefir starter culture did not 
      significantly affect the content of microorganisms. Lactobacilli, lactococci, and 
      yeast contents of kefir samples varied between 9.21 and 9.28, 9.23 and 9.29, and 
      4.71 and 5.53 log cfu/mL, respectively, on d 1 of storage. Contents of L. 
      acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. were between 5.78 and 6.43 and between 3.19 and 
      6.14 log cfu/mL, respectively, during 21 d of storage. During the storage period, 
      pH, lactic acid (%), total solids (%), protein (%), acetaldehyde, and ethanol 
      contents of kefir samples ranged from 4.29 to 4.53, from 0.81 to 0.95%, from 7.81 to 
      8.21%, from 3.09 to 3.48%, from 3.8 to 23.6 mg/L, and from 76.5 to 5,147 mg/L, 
      respectively. The exopolysaccharide contents of the samples decreased during 21 d of 
      cold storage; the samples fermented under modified atmosphere had relatively higher 
      exopolysaccharide contents, indicating higher potential therapeutic properties. The 
      kefir samples exhibited non-Newtonian pseudoplastic flow behavior according to the 
      power law model. According to the sensory results, kefir produced from natural kefir 
      starter culture under CO(2) atmosphere had the highest overall evaluation score at d 
      1.

PG  - 280-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine glycemic, insulinemic, and satiety indices of 3 types of 
      kefir. METHODS: This study was divided into 3 phases. In phase 1, 50 g of available 
      carbohydrate from low-fat strawberry kefir or orange kefir was tested, and in phase 
      2, low-fat plain kefir containing 25 g of available carbohydrates was tested for 
      glycemic index (GI), in both cases compared with an equivalent amount of glucose. In 
      phase 3, 1000-kJ portions of all 3 types of kefirs were compared with white bread 
      with the same energy content to determine the insulinemic index (II) and satiety 
      index (SI) of all 3 kefirs. In all phases, a single-meal, randomized crossover 
      design was performed in which the test meals were given to healthy adults, 5 men and 
      5 women. RESULTS: The total incremental plasma glucose area under the curve (iAUC) 
      for strawberry, orange, and plain kefirs was significantly lower compared with the 
      respective high-GI control food, which was glucose solution. However, the IIs and 
      SIs of kefir did not differ significantly from the white bread. CONCLUSION: Kefir is 
      a low- to moderate-GI food; however, its II was high. Although kefir had higher 
      water content, the SI of kefir was not significantly different from white bread.

AB  - The current study was designed to investigate the protective effect of kefir milk on 
      ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in γ-irradiated rats. The results of the present 
      study revealed that treatment with γ-irradiation and/or ethanol showed a significant 
      increase in ulcers number, total acidity, peptic, H(+)K(+)ATPase, MMP-2 and MMP-9 
      activities and MDA level, which were accompanied by a significant decrease in the 
      mucus content, the stomach GSH level, the GSH-Px activity and DNA damage. 
      Pre-treatment with kefir milk exert significant improvement in all the tested 
      parameters. Kefir milk exerts comparable effect to that of the antiulcer drug 
      ranitidine. In conclusion, the present study revealed that oral administration of 
      kefir milk prevents ethanol-induced gastric ulcer in γ-irradiated rats that could 
      attribute to its antioxidant, anti-apoptotic and radio-protective activities.

AB  - Swine grown under commercial conditions are vulnerable to environmental exposure to 
      several viruses, which may cause infectious diseases and spread easily and rapidly, 
      resulting in significant economic losses in animal husbandry. Previous studies have 
      suggested that probiotics seem to be a new and promising alternative to vaccinations 
      to protect animals against potential viral infections. In this study, we used the 
      Vero cell culture model of infection to study porcine epidemic diarrhea virus 
      (PEDV). We screened lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with anti-PEDV potential from kefir 
      grains, which are starter cultures used to ferment milk into kefir. Twenty-nine LAB 
      strains were isolated and identified as Enterococcus durans, Lactobacillus kefiri, 
      Lactococcus lactis, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, according to 16S ribosomal RNA 
      (rRNA) and rpoA gene sequence analyses. The anti-PEDV activities of the LAB 
      intracellular extracts were compared, and the intracellular extracts of Ln. 
      mesenteroides showed higher anti-PEDV activities than that of the other species. 
      Among the Ln. mesenteroides strains, a strain designated YPK30 showed a higher 
      growth rate than that of the other strains and was further evaluated for its 
      anti-PEDV activity. The results showed that the intracellular extracts of Ln. 
      mesenteroides YPK30 possessed in vitro prophylactic, therapeutic, and 
      direct-inhibitory effects against PEDV in the Vero cell model. The expression levels 
      of Type 1 interferon (IFN)-dependent genes, including Myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) 
      and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), were significantly increased after 
      treatment with intracellular extracts of Ln. mesenteroides YPK30 for 24 h. Such 
      expression suggests that the anti-PEDV activity of Ln. mesenteroides YPK30 could be 
      attributed to its up-regulatory effect on the expression of MX1 and ISG15 genes. 
      These results suggested that Ln. mesenteroides YPK30 has the potential to provide 
      some levels of host protection against PEDV infections.

TI  - Hypocholesterolaemic effects of milk-kefir and soyamilk-kefir in cholesterol-fed 
      hamsters.
PG  - 939-46
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the hypocholesterolaemic property of milk-kefir and 
      soyamilk-kefir. Male hamsters were fed on a cholesterol-free or cholesterol-enriched 
      diet containing 10 % skimmed milk, milk-kefir, soyamilk or soyamilk-kefir for a 
      period of 8 weeks. The soyamilk, milk-kefir and soyamilk-kefir diets all tended 
      towards a lowering of serum triacylglycerol and total cholesterol concentrations, 
      and a reduction of cholesterol accumulation in the liver, the decrease in serum 
      cholesterol concentration being mainly in the non-HDL fraction. The soyamilk-kefir 
      diet led to a significant increase in the faecal excretion of neutral sterols and 
      bile acids compared with the other two diets. The soyamilk-kefir diet also elicited 
      a significant decrease in the serum ratio of non-HDL-cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol, 
      compared with the control, than was the case for the other diets. These findings 
      demonstrate that soyamilk-kefir may be considered to be among the more promising 
      food components in terms of preventing CVD through its hypocholesterolaemic action.

TI  - Lactic Acid Bacteria from Kefir Increase Cytotoxicity of Natural Killer Cells to 
      Tumor Cells.
LID - 10.3390/foods7040048 [doi]
LID - 48
AB  - The Japanese fermented beverage, homemade kefir, contains six lactic acid bacteria: 
      Lactococcus. lactis subsp. Lactis, Lactococcus. lactis subsp. Cremoris, Lactococcus. 
      Lactis subsp. Lactis biovar diacetylactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Leuconostoc 
      meseuteroides subsp. Cremoris and Lactobacillus casei. In this study, we found that 
      a mixture of the six lactic acid bacteria from kefir increased the cytotoxicity of 
      human natural killer KHYG-1 cells to human chronic myelogenous leukemia K562 cells 
      and colorectal tumor HCT116 cells. Furthermore, levels of mRNA expression and 
      secretion of IFN-γ (interferon gamma) increased in KHYG-1 cells that had been 
      treated with the six lactic acid bacteria mixture from kefir. The results suggest 
      that the six lactic acid bacteria mixture from kefir has strong effects on natural 
      immunity and tumor cell cytotoxicity.

TI  - Mixed culture of Lactococcus lactis and Kluyveromyces marxianus isolated from kefir 
      grains for pollutants load removal from Jebel Chakir leachate.
PG  - 2041-2048

AB  - The wastewater from the dumping site usually contains high pollutant levels. 
      Biological process and physico-chemical treatments are among several technologies 
      for wastewater treatment. Using microorganisms in the treatment of landfill leachate 
      is an emerging research issue. Furthermore, bioremediation is a feasible approach 
      for pollutants removal from landfill leachate which would provide an efficient way 
      to resolve the issue of landfill leachate. In this study, the performance of yeast 
      and bacteria isolated from kefir grains was assessed for landfill leachate 
      treatment. Kefir grains microbial composition was evaluated by molecular approaches 
      (Rep-PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing). The obtained outcomes denoted that high 
      concentrations of lactic acid bacteria and yeast populations (over 10(7)  CFU/ml) 
      were found in the kefir grains and were essentially composed of Lactococcus lactis, 
      Lactobaccillus kefirien, bacillus sp., L. lactis, and Kluyveromyces marxianus. The 
      co-culture with 1% of inoculum size was demonstrated as the most efficient in the 
      degradation of different contaminants. The overall abatement rate of chemical oxygen 
      demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen ( NH4+ - N ), and salinity were 75.8%, 85.9%, and 
      75.13%, respectively. The bioremediation process resulted in up of 75% removal 
      efficiency of Ni and Cd, and a 73.45%, 68.53%, and a 58.17% removal rates of Cu, Pb, 
      and Fe, respectively. The research findings indicate the performance of L. lactis 
      and K. marxianus co-culture isolated from kefir grains for the bioremediation of 
      LFL. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Isolation and identification of microorganisms from kefir 
      grains was carried out. Biological treatment of LFL using monoculture of 
      (Lactoccocus lactis; Kluyveromyces marxianus) and co-culture (5% of L. lactis and 5% 
      K. marxianus) has been performed. Biological treatment using co-culture strain is an 
      effective approach to remove organic matter, NH4+ - N and heavy metals.

TI  - [The effect of kefir consumption on human immune system: a cytokine study].
PG  - 273-81
AB  - The systemic effects of bioactive peptides which are produced by the fermentation of 
      milk via the microorganisms found in kefir have been the subject of interest in 
      recent years. Bioactive peptides activate innate immunity by stimulating 
      macrophages, increasing phagocytosis, augmenting NO and cytokine production and 
      boosting the lumen levels of IgG and IgA+ B-lymphocytes. The aim of the present 
      study was to determine the serum cytokine profiles of healthy volunteers after kefir 
      consumption to evaluate helper T (TH) cell polarization and to bring out the effects 
      on native and allergic immune responses. The study was designed as a prospective and 
      self-controlled study. A total of 18 healthy volunteers (age range: 20-40 yrs, mean 
      age: 35.5 ± 7.38 yrs) from a university hospital staff were recruited to the study, 
      with the approval of ethical board and informed consent. The body mass indices of 
      all participants were between normal range (20.10-25.70 kg/m2). After two weeks of a 
      diet free from fermented products, the participants consumed 200 mL kefir daily, for 
      six weeks. Kefir product was prepared by using kefir starter culture (Danisco 
      Biolacta Sp - 05223B 10001, Poland) which contains Lactobacillus spp., Leuconostoc 
      spp., Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis and Streptococcus termophilus, an overnight 
      incubation at 26°C, and consumed freshly. Fasting blood samples of subjects were 
      collected just before kefir use (0th week), at the end of the 3rd and 6th weeks of 
      kefir consumption, and three weeks after cessation of kefir usage (9th week). Serum 
      TNF-a, IL-1, IL-5, IL-8 and TGF-β levels were measured by using commercial ELISA 
      kits (BioSource, Belgium and Invitrogen, USA). Hemoglobin, serum creatinine and ALT 
      levels of all subjects were also determined for follow-up. All volunteers completed 
      the study period without any problem and declared no complaint. Hemoglobin, 
      creatinine and ALT levels did not change with kefir consumption. Serum IL-8 levels 
      were decreased at 3rd and 6th weeks (p< 0.001) and were at low levels at 9th week 
      (p= 0.005) when compared with baseline levels (0th week). Serum IL-5 levels were 
      increased at 3rd week (0th-3rd weeks; p= 0.01) and decreased by a rebound effect at 
      9th week (6th-9th week p= 0.003). TNF-α levels were increased with kefir consumption 
      (p= 0.046) but the increase was insignificant in paired comparisons and the level 
      was borderline between 0th and 6th weeks (p= 0.013). IL-5 and TNF-α levels returned 
      to their original levels (0th week) at 9th week. Levels of the other cytokines (IL-1 
      and TGF-β) did not change significantly with kefir usage. These results indicated 
      that kefir use increased polarization of the immune response towards TH1 type and 
      decreased TH2 type response and accordingly allergic response. The decrease in IL-8 
      level due to kefir use, might control the inflammatory response by suppressing 
      neutrophil chemotaxis and activation. On the other hand it was also concluded that 
      increased IL-5 might stimulate secretory IgA at gastrointestinal mucosa leading to a 
      more efficient immune response in the intestinal lumen.

AB  - The study aimed to evaluate the effect of kefir combination from goat milk and soy 
      milk on lipid profile, plasma glucose, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and the 
      improvement of pancreatic β-cell in diabetic rats. Male rats were divided into five 
      treatments: normal control, diabetic control, goat milk kefir, combination of goat 
      milk-soy milk kefir and soy milk kefir. All rats were induced by 
      streptooztocin-nicotinamide (STZ-NA), except for normal control. After 35 d 
      experiment, the rats were sampled for blood, sacrificed and sampled for pancreatic 
      tissues. Results showed that diabetic rats fed kefir combination had higher (p<0.05) 
      triglyceride than the rats fed goat milk or soy milk kefir. Decreasing of plasma 
      glucose in diabetic rats fed kefir combination was higher (p<0.05) than rats fed 
      goat millk kefir. The activity of GPx in diabetic rats fed three kinds of kefir were 
      higher (p<0.01) than untreated diabetic rats. The average number of Langerhans and 
      β-cells in diabetic rats fed kefir combination was the same as the normal control, 
      but it was higher than diabetic control. It was concluded that kefir combination can 
      be used as antidiabetic through maintaining in serum triglyceride, decreasing in 
      plasma glucose, increasing in GPx activity and improving in pancreatic β-cells.

TI  - Yeasts from kefir grains: isolation, identification, and probiotic characterization.
PG  - 43-53
LID - 10.1007/s11274-013-1419-9 [doi]
AB  - Kefir-a traditional beverage whose consumption has been associated with health 
      benefits-is a logical natural product to investigate for new probiotic strains. The 
      aim of the present work was to isolate and identify kefir yeasts and select those 
      with acid and bile tolerance to study their adhesion to epithelial cells and their 
      transit through mouse gut. From 4 milky and 3 sugary kefir grains, 34 yeast strains 
      were isolated and identified by means of classical microbiological and 
      molecular-genetic methods (whole-cell protein pattern, internal-transcribed-spacer 
      amplification, and analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms). We 
      identified 4 species belonging to 3 genera-Saccharomyces cerevisiae (15 strains), 
      Saccharomyces unisporus (6 strains), Issatchenkia occidentalis (4 strains), and 
      Kluyveromyces marxianus (9 strains)-and selected 13 strains on the basis of 
      resistance to low pH and bile salts. Among the strains selected, Kluyveromyces 
      marxianus CIDCA 8154 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae CIDCA 8112 were further studied. 
      Both strains evidenced the capacity to adhere to epithelial intestine-derived cells 
      in vitro and to survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract of BALB/c mice. 
      The investigation of the potential probiotic features of these kefir-yeast strains 
      should be useful for the development of novel functional foods.

TI  - Determination of lactic microflora of kefir grains and kefir beverage by using 
      culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
PG  - M276-83
LID - 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02191.x [doi]
AB  - In this study, we investigated the bacterial compositions of kefir grains and kefir 
      beverages collected from different regions of Turkey by using culture-independent 
      and culture-dependent methods. In the culture-independent detection, 10 different 
      species of bacteria were detected in total by using the polymerase chain 
      reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis of the 16S rRNA 
      gene V3 region. Among these species, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was the most 
      dominant one in the kefir grains, while Lactococcus lactis was found to be 
      significantly prevalent in the kefir beverages. In the culture-dependent detection, 
      the primary differentiation and grouping of the isolates from kefir beverages and 
      kefir grains were performed using repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) 
      fingerprinting, and the results were validated by 16S rDNA full-length sequencing. 
      According to the results of culture-dependent methods, the most frequently isolated 
      species were L. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Lactobacillus kefiri, 
      respectively. Only 3 species, which are L. lactis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, 
      and Streptococcus thermophilus, were detected with both culture-dependent and 
      culture-independent methods. This study showed that the combination of both methods 
      is necessary for a detailed and reliable investigation of microbial communities in 
      kefir grains and kefir beverages. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Due to their artisan- and 
      region-dependent microflora, kefir products can be a source of interesting lactic 
      acid bacteria, either new taxa or strains with specific functional properties, which 
      might be used for the development of new starter cultures and innovative food 
      products. Therefore, an increasing demand exists for new strains that show desirable 
      effects on the product characteristics Artisan dairy products are a candidate source 
      of such microorganisms. For this reason, in this study, the bacterial compositions 
      of kefir grains and kefir beverages obtained from different regions of Turkey were 
      studied using culture-dependent and culture-independent molecular methods.

AB  - The microbial diversity of water kefir, made from a mixture of water, dried figs, a 
      slice of lemon and sucrose was studied. The microbial consortia residing in the 
      granules of three water kefirs of different origins were analyzed. A collection of 
      453 bacterial isolates was obtained on different selective/differential media. 
      Bacterial isolates were grouped with randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR 
      analyses. One representative of each RAPD genotype was identified by comparative 16S 
      rDNA gene sequencing. The predominant genus in water kefirs I and II was 
      Lactobacillus, which accounted for 82.1% in water kefir I and 72.1% in water kefir 
      II of the bacterial isolates. The most abundant species in water kefirs I and II 
      were Lactobacillus hordei and Lb. nagelii followed by considerably lower numbers of 
      Lb. casei. Other lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were identified as Leuconostoc 
      mesenteroides and Lc. citreum in all three water kefirs. The most abundant species 
      in water kefir III was Lc. mesenteroides (28%) and Lc. citreum (24.3%). A total of 
      57 LAB belonging to the species of Lb. casei, Lb. hordei, Lb. nagelii, Lb. hilgardii 
      and Lc. mesenteroides were able to produce exopolysacchrides from sucrose. Non LABs 
      were identified as Acetobacter fabarum and Ac. orientalis. The Acetobacter species 
      were more prevalent in consortium III. Cluster analyses of RAPD-PCR patterns 
      revealed an interspecies diversity among the Lactobacillus and Acetobacter strains. 
      Aditionally, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lachancea fermentati, Hanseniaospora 
      valbyensis and Zygotorulaspora florentina were isolated and identified by comparison 
      of partial 26S rDNA sequences and FTIR spectroscopy.

AB  - Three thermal drying methods (conventional, vacuum and convective) were used for 
      drying of kefir biomass and their effect on cell viability, fermentation rate and 
      other kinetic parameters of lactose and whey fermentation were studied. Convective 
      drying rate was higher than conventional and even higher than vacuum at each studied 
      temperature (28, 33 and 38 degrees C). After that, fermentations were performed by 
      kefir biomass dried by the three drying methods. Ethanol concentration, ethanol 
      productivity and ethanol yield are higher in whey fermentations performed by kefir 
      biomass dried with convective drying method. Regarding lactic acid production, 
      fermentation performed by kefir biomass dried with conventional drying method gave 
      higher concentrations, compared to other drying methods. Storage of kefir biomass 
      convectively dried at 33 degrees C for 4months, without any precaution decreases its 
      fermentability and thus reduces ethanol (31%) and lactic acid productivity (20%), 
      but remains a promising technology, since a significant part of its initial 
      fermentative activity is retained.

TI  - Kefir yeast technology: scale-up in SCP production using milk whey.
PG  - 788-96
AB  - A three-step process to scale-up kefir biomass production at a semi-industrial scale 
      employing whey is reported. Aerobic fermentations were initially performed at 
      laboratory scales, in 1.5- and 4-L bioreactors, yielding 79 g/L final kefir biomass 
      (0.89 g/g of lactose utilized), in 7 h of fermentation time. The use of whey as 
      carbon source even in solid cultures led to the formation of a granular biomass. 
      These results encouraged scale-up at a semi-industrial-scale pilot plant employing 
      100- and 3,000-L bioreactors, leading to the development of a process for granular 
      kefir biomass production. The results validated the laboratory-scale experiments and 
      the avoidance of centrifugal separators due to granular biomass formation. 
      Pilot-plant operations showed kefir to be highly resistant to contamination under 
      actual industrial conditions and no serious problems in handling of raw materials 
      and equipment were observed. Economic analysis showed a 20% higher cost of the 
      market price of products, with added value of up to 15.9 x 10(9) within the European 
      Union.

TI  - Modelling of aflatoxin G1 reduction by kefir grain using response surface 
      methodology.

LID - 40
AB  - Aflatoxin G1 (AFG1) is one of the main toxic contaminants in pistachio nuts and 
      causes potential health hazards. Hence, AFG1 reduction is one of the main concerns 
      in food safety. Kefir-grains contain symbiotic association of microorganisms well 
      known for their aflatoxin decontamination effects. In this study, a central 
      composite design (CCD) using response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to 
      develop a model in order to predict AFG1 reduction in pistachio nuts by kefir-grain 
      (already heated at 70 and 110°C). The independent variables were: toxin 
      concentration (X1: 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 ng/g), kefir-grain level (X2: 5, 10, 20, 10 
      and 25%), contact time (X3: 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 h), and incubation temperature (X4: 20, 
      30, 40, 50 and 60°C). There was a significant reduction in AFG1 (p < 0.05) when 
      pre-heat-treated kefir-grain used. The variables including X1, X3 and the 
      interactions between X2-X4 as well as X3-X4 have significant effects on AFG1 
      reduction. The model provided a good prediction of AFG1 reduction under the assay 
      conditions. Optimization was used to enhance the efficiency of kefir-grain on AFG1 
      reduction. The optimum conditions for the highest AFG1 reduction (96.8%) were 
      predicted by the model as follows: toxin concentration = 20 ng/g, kefir-grain 
      level = 10%, contact time = 6 h, and incubation temperature = 30°C which validated 
      practically in six replications.

AB  - In this study, a yeast-like fungal strain (LG-8), newly isolated from spontaneous 
      Tibet kefir in China, was identified as Geotrichum candidum on the basis of its 
      morphological characteristics and ITS5.8S gene sequence. Interestingly, the strain 
      was able to remove more than 99% of Pb(2+) ions in water at low concentrations and a 
      maximum of 325.68 mg lead/g of dry biomass. The results of selective passivation 
      experiments suggested that phosphate, amide and carboxyl groups on the cell wall 
      contributed to lead removal. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photomicrographs 
      revealed that large amounts of micro/nanoparticles formed on the cell wall, and 
      energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) results further indicated the presence of 
      lead along with phosphorus and chlorine in the particles. Furthermore, the results 
      of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
      analyses revealed that the particles were composed of pyromorphite 
      [Pb(5)(PO4)(3)Cl], a highly insoluble lead mineral. Importantly, this is the first 
      time that the biomineralization of lead into pyromorphite has been observed as the 
      major mechanism for lead removal by G. candidum LG-8, providing a new strategy to 
      scavenge heavy metals from aquatic environment in an eco-friendly manner.

      in five Tibetan kefir grains (grain group) and five related kefir milks (milk group) 
      via a combination of high-throughput sequencing technology and comparative 
      bioinformatics analyses. According to the high-throughput sequencing technology, a 
      total of 2,099,928 and 1,978,404 high-quality valid sequences were obtained from the 
      bacterial and fungal communities of ten analyzed samples, respectively. Sequences 
      were analyzed from family to species level for microbial community composition 
      analysis. At the species level, a total of thirteen bacterial species and forty-six 
      fungal species were detected, among which eight bacterial species and six fungal 
      species with the relative abundances higher than 0.05% in at least one sample were 
      further applied for the comparative bioinformatics analyses in the microbial 
      community composition between the grain group (TKG1-5) and milk group (TK1-5), 
      revealing that the fungal community compositions of grain and milk groups were 
      similar; however, considerable differences were found in the bacterial community 
      composition between the grain and milk groups. Both differences and similarities in 
      the microbial community composition between the grain and milk groups were clearly 
      revealed.

AB  - Azo dyes are recalcitrant pollutants, which are toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic and 
      teratogenic, that constitute a significant burden to the environment. The 
      decolorization and the mineralization efficiency of Remazol Brillant Orange 3R (RBO 
      3R) was studied using a probiotic consortium (Lactobacillus acidophilus and 
      Lactobacillus plantarum). Biodegradation of RBO 3R (750 ppm) was investigated under 
      shaking condition in Mineral Salt Medium (MSM) solution at pH 11.5 and temperature 
      25°C. The bio-decolorization process was further confirmed by FTIR and UV-Vis 
      analysis. Under optimal conditions, the bacterial consortium was able to decolorize 
      the dye completely (>99%) within 12 h. The color removal was 99.37% at 750 ppm. 
      Muliplex PCR technique was used to detect the Lactobacillus genes. Using 
      phytotoxicity, cytotoxicity, mutagenicity and biototoxicity endpoints, toxicological 
      studies of RBO 3R before and after biodegradation were examined. A toxicity assay 
      signaled that biodegradation led to detoxification of RBO 3R dye.

AB  - The genus Corynebacterium includes Gram-positive species with a high G+C content. We 
      report here a novel species, Corynebacterium kefirresidentii SB, isolated from kefir 
      grains collected in Germany. Its draft genome sequence was remarkably dissimilar 
      (average nucleotide identity, 76.54%) to those of other Corynebacterium spp., 
      confirming that this is a unique novel species.

TI  - Brazilian kefir: structure, microbial communities and chemical composition.
PG  - 693-702
LID - 10.1590/S1517-838220110002000034 [doi]
AB  - Microbial ecology and chemical composition of Brazilian kefir beverage was 
      performed. The microorganisms associated with Brazilian kefir were investigated 
      using a combination of phenotypic and genotypic methods. A total of 359 microbial 
      isolates were identified. Lactic acid bacteria (60.5%) were the major isolated group 
      identified, followed by yeasts (30.6%) and acetic acid bacteria (8.9%). 
      Lactobacillus paracasei (89 isolates), Lactobacillus parabuchneri (41 isolates), 
      Lactobacillus casei (32 isolates), Lactobacillus kefiri (31 isolates), Lactococcus 
      lactis (24 isolates), Acetobacter lovaniensis (32 isolates), Kluyveromyces lactis 
      (31 isolates), Kazachstania aerobia (23 isolates), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (41 
      isolates) and Lachancea meyersii (15 isolates) were the microbial species isolated. 
      Scanning electron microscopy showed that the microbiota was dominated by bacilli 
      (short and curved long) cells growing in close association with lemon-shaped yeasts 
      cells. During the 24 h of fermentation, the protein content increased, while lactose 
      and fat content decreased. The concentration of lactic acid ranged from 1.4 to 17.4 
      mg/ml, and that of acetic acid increased from 2.1 to 2.73 mg/ml. The production of 
      ethanol was limited, reaching a final mean value of 0.5 mg/ml.

TI  - Therapeutic effect of lyophilized, Kefir-fermented milk on constipation among 
      persons with mental and physical disabilities.
PG  - 218-225
LID - 10.1111/jjns.12189 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Constipation is a serious problem for persons with mental and physical 
      disabilities in Japan. However, prophylaxis is extremely difficult because the major 
      causes of constipation in these individuals are related to their mental and physical 
      disabilities. Constipation can be successfully treated with glycerol enemas (GEs) 
      and other aperients. As constipation is a lifetime issue for these persons, dietary 
      regimens to prevent constipation can be important. METHODS: This study evaluated the 
      probiotic effects of kefir-fermented milk for preventing constipation in 42 persons 
      with mental and physical disabilities. The participants were administered 2 g of 
      lyophilized kefir with each meal for 12 weeks and their bowel movements, the 
      administration of GE and other aperients, and stool shape were recorded. RESULTS: 
      The intake of kefir significantly reduced constipation, compared with the baseline 
      status. Some individuals showed complete relief of constipation, whereas others 
      showed no effect. CONCLUSION: Despite individual variations, consuming kefir daily 
      could prevent constipation.

TI  - Synbiotic Effect of Whole Grape Seed Flour and Newly Isolated Kefir Lactic Acid 
      Bacteria on Intestinal Microbiota of Diet-Induced Obese Mice.
PG  - 13131-13137
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.0c01240 [doi]
AB  - Alterations of intestinal microbiota by synbiotic action of pre- and probiotics may 
      confer health benefits to the host. In this study, high-throughput sequencing of 16S 
      rRNA was used to analyze intestinal microbiota in feces, and the relative abundance 
      of intestinal bacteria was correlated with physiological data from a prior study of 
      a synbiotic combination of flavonoid-rich wine grape seed flour (WGF) and two newly 
      isolated kefir lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in diet-induced obese mice. The 
      combination of WGF and LAB enhanced observed operational taxonomic units and Chao1 
      index compared to WGF alone, indicating an increase in the microbial community 
      richness. The combination significantly enhanced abundance of Akkermansia 
      muciniphila and Nocardia coeliaca and their abundance had an inverse relationship 
      with body weight gain and adipose weight. In conclusion, the synbiotic effects of 
      WGF and LAB on improvement of high-fat-diet-induced obesity are strongly linked to 
      remodeling intestinal microbiota.

TI  - Microbial Succession and Flavor Production in the Fermented Dairy Beverage Kefir.
LID - e00052-16
AB  - Kefir is a putatively health-promoting dairy beverage that is produced when a kefir 
      grain, consisting of a consortium of microorganisms, is added to milk to initiate a 
      natural fermentation. Here, a detailed analysis was carried out to determine how the 
      microbial population, gene content, and flavor of three kefirs from distinct 
      geographic locations change over the course of 24-h fermentations. Metagenomic 
      sequencing revealed that Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was the dominant bacterial 
      species in kefir during early stages of fermentations but that Leuconostoc 
      mesenteroides became more prevalent in later stages. This pattern is consistent with 
      an observation that genes involved in aromatic amino acid biosynthesis were absent 
      from L. kefiranofaciens but were present in L. mesenteroides. Additionally, these 
      shifts in the microbial community structure, and associated pathways, corresponded 
      to changes in the levels of volatile compounds. Specifically, Acetobacter spp. 
      correlated with acetic acid; Lactobacillus spp. correlated with carboxylic acids, 
      esters and ketones; Leuconostoc spp. correlated with acetic acid and 
      2,3-butanedione; and Saccharomyces spp. correlated with esters. The correlation data 
      suggest a causal relationship between microbial taxa and flavor that is supported by 
      observations that addition of L. kefiranofaciens NCFB 2797 increased the levels of 
      esters and ketones whereas addition of L. mesenteroides 213M0 increased the levels 
      of acetic acid and 2,3-butanedione. Finally, we detected genes associated with 
      probiotic functionalities in the kefir microbiome. Our results illustrate the 
      dynamic nature of kefir fermentations and microbial succession patterns therein and 
      can be applied to optimize the fermentation processes, flavors, and health-related 
      attributes of this and other fermented foods. IMPORTANCE Traditional fermented foods 
      represent relatively low-complexity microbial environments that can be used as model 
      microbial communities to understand how microbes interact in natural environments. 
      Our results illustrate the dynamic nature of kefir fermentations and microbial 
      succession patterns therein. In the process, the link between individual species, 
      and associated pathways, with flavor compounds is revealed and several genes that 
      could be responsible for the purported gut health-associated benefits of consuming 
      kefir are identified. Ultimately, in addition to providing an important fundamental 
      insight into microbial interactions, this information can be applied to optimize the 
      fermentation processes, flavors, and health-related attributes of this and other 
      fermented foods.

PG  - 481-6

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of kefir and banana pulp and skin flours on the 
      serum levels of total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c and triacylglycerols in rats fed 
      cholesterol-rich diet. METHODS: Thirty Male Wistar rats were used. In the first 21 
      days, the animals were fed purified hypercholesterolemic diets, except the standard 
      group. In the next 21 days, the animals were given modified diets: Group GC: 
      standard diet AIN-93G; Group HIP: hypercholesterolemic diet; Group F: 
      hypercholesterolemic diet added of 1% of banana skin flour and 7% of banana pulp 
      flour; Group Q: hypercholesterolemic diet plus kefir suspension by oral infusion 
      (1.5 ml/animal); Group FQ: hypercholesterolemic diet added of 1% banana skin flour 
      and 7% of banana pulp flour plus kefir suspension (1.5 ml/animal). RESULTS: In spite 
      of the high fiber content, the addition of banana pulp (7%) and skin (1%) flour did 
      not alter the plasma levels of total cholesterol, HDL-c and LDL-c. However, they 
      reduced the TG levels in 22%. Already fermented kefir reduced significantly the 
      levels of VLDL, LDL-c and triacylglycerols, in addition to having increased HDL-c. 
      However, it was not possible to verify the symbiotic effect between both. 
      CONCLUSION: The results reinforce the beneficial effects of kefir in reducing the 
      risks of cardiovascular diseases.

TI  - Microbial species diversity, community dynamics, and metabolite kinetics of water 
      kefir fermentation.
PG  - 2564-72
LID - 10.1128/AEM.03978-13 [doi]
AB  - Water kefir is a sour, alcoholic, and fruity fermented beverage of which the 
      fermentation is started with water kefir grains. These water kefir grains consist of 
      polysaccharide and contain the microorganisms responsible for the water kefir 
      fermentation. In this work, a water kefir fermentation process was followed as a 
      function of time during 192 h to unravel the community dynamics, the species 
      diversity, and the kinetics of substrate consumption and metabolite production. The 
      majority of the water kefir ecosystem was found to be present on the water kefir 
      grains. The most important microbial species present were Lactobacillus 
      casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus harbinensis, Lactobacillus hilgardii, Bifidobacterium 
      psychraerophilum/crudilactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Dekkera bruxellensis. 
      The microbial species diversities in the water kefir liquor and on the water kefir 
      grains were similar and remained stable during the whole fermentation process. The 
      major substrate, sucrose, was completely converted after 24 h of fermentation, which 
      coincided with the production of the major part of the water kefir grain 
      polysaccharide. The main metabolites of the fermentation were ethanol and lactic 
      acid. Glycerol, acetic acid, and mannitol were produced in low concentrations. The 
      major part of these metabolites was produced during the first 72 h of fermentation, 
      during which the pH decreased from 4.26 to 3.45. The most prevalent volatile aroma 
      compounds were ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl hexanoate, ethyl octanoate, and 
      ethyl decanoate, which might be of significance with respect to the aroma of the end 
      product.

TI  - Development, Characterization, and Bioactivity of Non-Dairy Kefir-Like Fermented 
      Beverage Based on Flaxseed Oil Cake.
LID - 10.3390/foods8110544 [doi]
LID - 544
AB  - Flaxseed oil cake (FOC) was evaluated as a potential substrate for the production of 
      a novel kefir-like fermented beverage. Three variants containing 5%, 10%, and 15% 
      (w/w) of FOC were inoculated with kefir grains and incubated at 25 °C for 24 h. 
      After processing, beverages were stored in refrigerated conditions (6 °C) for 21 
      days. Changes in microbial population, pH, acidity, levels of proteins, 
      polyphenolics, flavonoids, ascorbic acid, and reducing sugars were estimated. 
      Additionally, viscosity, firmness, color, and antioxidant properties were 
      determined. Results showed that lactic acid bacteria as well as yeast were capable 
      of growing well in the FOC without any supplementation. During refrigerated storage, 
      the viability of the microorganisms were over the recommended minimum level for 
      kefir products. As a result of fermentation, the beverages showed excellent 
      antioxidant activity. Because of the functional characteristics conferred to the FOC 
      beverages, the use of kefir grains showed adequate potential for the industrial 
      application. Therefore, this beverages could be used as a new, non-dairy vehicle for 
      beneficial microflora consumption, especially by vegans and lactose-intolerant 
      consumers.

TI  - Preservation of probiotic strains isolated from kefir by spray drying.
PG  - 7-12
LID - 10.1111/j.1472-765X.2009.02759.x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This work aims to investigate the survival of Lactobacillus kefir CIDCA 8348, 
      Lactobacillus plantarum CIDCA 83114 and Saccharomyces lipolytica CIDCA 812, all 
      isolated from kefir, during spray drying and subsequent storage. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: Micro-organisms were grown in De Man, Rogosa, Sharpe (MRS) or yeast medium 
      (YM) medium and harvested in the stationary phase of growth. The thermotolerance in 
      skim milk (D and Z values), the survival of spray drying at different outlet air 
      temperatures and subsequent storage in different conditions during 150 days were 
      studied. The resistance to the heat treatments was higher in Lact. plantarum 
      compared to Lact. kefir and S. lipolytica. The three micro-organisms studied varied 
      considerably in their ability to survive to spray drying processes. Lactobacillus 
      plantarum showed the highest survival rate for all the tested outlet air 
      temperatures and also to the further storage in the dried state. The survival rates 
      of Lact. kefir and S. lipolytica through drying and subsequent storage in the dried 
      state decreased when the drying outlet air temperatures increased. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Spray drying is a suitable method to preserve micro-organisms isolated from kefir 
      grains. A high proportion of cells were still viable after 80 days of storage at 
      refrigerated temperatures. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: It is the first report 
      about spray-dried probiotic strains isolated from kefir grain and contributes to the 
      knowledge about these micro-organisms for their future application in novel 
      dehydrated products.

TI  - Kefir-isolated bacteria and yeasts inhibit Shigella flexneri invasion and modulate 
      pro-inflammatory response on intestinal epithelial cells.
PG  - 103-110
LID - 10.3920/BM2015.0061 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of a kefir-isolated microbial 
      mixture containing three bacterial and two yeast strains (MM) to protect intestinal 
      epithelial cells against Shigella flexneri invasion, as well as to analyse the 
      effect on pro-inflammatory response elicited by this pathogen. A significant 
      decrease in S. flexneri strain 72 invasion was observed on both HT-29 and Caco-2 
      cells pre-incubated with MM. Pre-incubation with the individual strains 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae CIDCA 8112 or Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis CIDCA 8221 
      also reduced the internalisation of S. flexneri into HT-29 cells although in a 
      lesser extent than MM. Interestingly, Lactobacillus plantarum CIDCA 83114 exerted a 
      protective effect on the invasion of Caco-2 and HT-29 cells by S. flexneri. 
      Regarding the pro-inflammatory response on HT-29 cells, S. flexneri infection 
      induced a significant activation of the expression of interleukin 8 (IL-8), 
      chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) 
      encoding genes (P<0.05), whereas incubation of cells with MM did not induce the 
      expression of any of the mediators assessed. Interestingly, pre-incubation of HT-29 
      monolayer with MM produced an inhibition of S. flexneri-induced IL-8, CCL20 and 
      TNF-α mRNA expression. In order to gain insight on the effect of MM (or the 
      individual strains) on this pro-inflammatory response, a series of experiments using 
      a HT-29-NF-κB-hrGFP reporter system were performed. Pre-incubation of 
      HT-29-NF-κB-hrGFP cells with MM significantly dampened Shigella-induced activation. 
      Our results showed that the contribution of yeast strain Kluyveromyces marxianus 
      CIDCA 8154 seems to be crucial in the observed effect. In conclusion, results 
      presented in this study demonstrate that pre-treatment with a microbial mixture 
      containing bacteria and yeasts isolated from kefir, resulted in inhibition of S. 
      flexneri internalisation into human intestinal epithelial cells, along with the 
      inhibition of the signalling via NF-κB that in turn led to the attenuation of the 
      inflammatory response.

AB  - Kefir has a long tradition in human nutrition due to its presupposed health 
      promoting effects. To investigate the potential contribution of bioactive peptides 
      to the physiological effects of kefir, comprehensive analysis of the peptide profile 
      was performed by nano-ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap MS coupled to nano-ultrahigh-performance 
      liquid chromatography. Thus, 257 peptides were identified, mainly released from 
      β-casein, followed by αS1-, κ-, and αS2-casein. Most (236) peptides were uniquely 
      detected in kefir, but not in raw milk indicating that the fermentation step does 
      not only increase the proteolytic activity 1.7- to 2.4-fold compared to unfermented 
      milk, but also alters the composition of the peptide fraction. The influence of the 
      microflora was determined by analyzing kefir produced from traditional kefir grains 
      or commercial starter culture. Kefir from starter culture featured 230 peptide 
      sequences and showed a significantly, 1.4-fold higher proteolytic activity than 
      kefir from kefir grains with 127 peptides. A match of 97 peptides in both varieties 
      indicates the presence of a typical kefir peptide profile that is not influenced by 
      the individual composition of the microflora. Sixteen of the newly identified 
      peptides were previously described as bioactive, including angiotensin-converting 
      enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory, antimicrobial, immunomodulating, opioid, mineral binding, 
      antioxidant, and antithrombotic effects. BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The present study 
      describes a comprehensive peptide profile of kefir comprising 257 sequences. The 
      peptide list was used to identify 16 bioactive peptides with ACE-inhibitory, 
      antioxidant, antithrombotic, mineral binding, antimicrobial, immunomodulating and 
      opioid activity in kefir. Furthermore, it was shown that a majority of the kefir 
      peptides were not endogenously present in the raw material milk, but were released 
      from milk caseins by proteases of the microbiota and are therefore specific for the 
      product. Consequently, the proteolytic activity and the composition of the peptide 
      profile can be controlled by the applied microflora (grains or starter culture). On 
      the other hand, a considerable portion of the peptide profile was identified to be 
      typical for kefir in general and independent from production parameters. In summary, 
      the generated kefir peptide profile helped to reveal its origin and to identify 
      bioactive peptides in kefir, which may advance the understanding of health benefits 
      of this food product. The results further indicate that subsets of the kefir peptide 
      list can be used as markers to control food authenticity, for example, to 
      distinguish different types of kefir.

AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To determine kefir's effect on the prevention of 
      gastrointestinal complaints and quality of life (QOL) in patients being treated for 
      colorectal cancer. DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, prospective, interventional 
      study. SETTING: Istanbul University Oncology Institute in Turkey. SAMPLE: 40 
      patients, 20 of whom were randomized to the experimental (kefir) arm and 20 who were 
      randomized to the control arm. METHODS: Informed consent to participate in the study 
      was obtained. Before treatment began, demographics, illness-related characteristics, 
      complaints, and QOL of participants were evaluated. During treatment, side effects 
      were evaluated one week after every cycle of therapy. QOL was evaluated after the 
      third and sixth cycles of treatment. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: The effect of kefir on 
      the prevention of gastrointestinal complaints and QOL in patients being treated for 
      colorectal cancer. FINDINGS: Following chemotherapy, the experimental (kefir) group 
      had more treatment-related gastrointestinal complaints but a decrease in sleep 
      disturbance. No difference was found between the two groups for QOL. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Kefir does not prevent or decrease gastrointestinal complaints in patients 
      undergoing chemotherapy for colorectal cancer. Kefir did decrease sleep disturbances 
      in the experimental group. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Many patients use complementary 
      and alternative medicine during cancer therapy. This study may provide information 
      about the effectiveness of kefir in patients with cancer.

AB  - This study investigates the performance of the combination of biological 
      pre-treatment with Kefir grains (KGs) and photocatalytic process using Ag-doped 
      TiO(2) nanoparticles (NPs) for the simultaneous removal of toxic pollutants from 
      landfill leachate (LFL). After 5 days of 1% (w/v) KGs pre-treatment at 37 °C, TOC, 
      COD, NH(4)(+)-N, and PO(4)(3-) removal rates were 93, 83.33, 70 and 88.25%, 
      respectively. The removal efficiencies were found to be 100, 94, 62.5, 53.16 and 
      47.52 % for Cd, Ni, Zn, Mn and Cu, respectively. The optimal conditions of Ag-doped 
      TiO(2) photocatalytic process were optimized using Box-Behnken design and response 
      surface methodology (BBD-RSM) to enhance the quality of pre-treated LFL. 
      Interestingly, Ag-doped TiO(2) photocatalytic process increases the overall removal 
      efficiencies to 98, 96, 85 and 93% of TOC, COD, NH(4)(+)-N, and PO(4)(3-), 
      respectively. Furthermore, the removal efficiency of toxic heavy metals was 
      gradually improved. In addition, KGs and Ag-doped TiO(2) exhibited excellent 
      recyclability showing the potential of combined biological/photocatalytic process to 
      treat hazardous LFL.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Kefir is obtained by the action of acidic bacteria and yeasts that exist 
      in symbiotic association in kefir grains. Recently, this fermented milk drink has 
      been recommended for the treatment of several clinical conditions, such as 
      inflammatory, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular-related diseases, or a combination 
      of these diseases. However, its effects on atherosclerosis are not yet clear. The 
      aim of this study was to prove that chronic treatment with a soluble, nonbacterial 
      fraction of kefir could reduce the progression of atherosclerosis in low-density 
      lipoprotein receptor-deficient (LDLr(-/-)) mice. METHODS: LDLr(-/-) mice were 
      divided into four groups as follows: RESULTS: The soluble, nonbacterial fraction of 
      kefir reduced lipid deposition (P < 0.05) independent of hypercholesterolemia. 
      Moreover, kefir was capable of diminishing the circulating proinflammatory 
      intereukin (IL)-6 level and the ratio of tumor necrosis factor-α to IL-10 (50% and 
      42%, P < 0.05, respectively) and augmenting the antiinflammatory IL-10 level by 
      approximately 74% (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic treatment with a soluble 
      nonbacterial fraction of kefir was able to decrease the lipid deposition in 
      LDLr(-/-) hypercholesteremic mice, at least in part through modifying the 
      circulating cytokine profile. The beneficial effects of kefir provide new 
      perspectives for its use as an adjuvant in the prevention of atherosclerosis.

AB  - The present study evaluates the effects of dietary kefir and low molecular weight 
      sodium alginate (LWMSA) (singular or combined) on non-specific immune response, 
      disease resistance and growth performance of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). 
      Fish with average weight of 18.60 ± 0.04 g were supplied and randomly stocked in 
      sixteen glass tanks (150 L) at density of 20 fish per tank. Fish were fed 
      experimental diets as follows: 0 g kg(-1) LMWSA (Control, Diet 1), 10 g kg(-1) LMWSA 
      (Diet 2), 40 g kg(-1) kefir (Diet 3), and 10 g kg(-1) LMWSA + 40 g kg(-1) kefir 
      (Diet 4) for 50 days. At the end of the feeding trial, serum lysozyme (SL), 
      phagocytosis (PI), respiratory burst (RB), and alternative complement (ACH50) 
      activities as well as growth performance were measured. Singular and combined 
      administration of kefir and low molecular weight sodium alginate (LMWSA) 
      significantly increased serum SL, PI, RB, and ACH50 activities compared control 
      group (P < 0.05); the highest innate immune responses were observed in fish fed 
      combinational diet (kefir + LMWSA) (P < 0.05). The results of experimental challenge 
      revealed significantly higher resistance against Streptococcus agalactiae in fish 
      fed supplemented diets and the highest post challenge survival rate was observed in 
      synbiotic diet (P < 0.05). Similar results obtained in case of growth parameters. 
      Feeding on supplemented diet significantly improved SGR and FCR and the highest 
      growth parameters was observed in fish fed synbiotic diet (P < 0.05). These finding 
      revealed that combined administration of dietary kefir and LMWSA can be considered 
      for improving immune response, disease resistance and growth performance of Nile 
      tilapia.

AB  - This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of milk or molasses kefir as a 
      probiotic on growth performance, carcass traits, serum biochemistry and humoral 
      immune responses in broiler chickens. A total of 192 one-d-old as hatched broiler 
      chicks (Ross 308) were randomly allotted to 4 treatments, each with 4 replicate pens 
      of 12 chicks. The following treatments were applied: 1) a basal diet (C) and normal 
      drinking water, 2) 2% milk kefir in drinking water, 3) 2% molasses kefir in drinking 
      water, and 4) the diet C supplemented with commercial probiotic. At d 42, eight 
      birds per treatment were killed for determination of carcass traits. Broilers at 28 
      days of age were bled for measuring antibody titers against Newcastle disease virus 
      (NDV) and avian influenza virus (AIV), at 30 days of age for antibody titers against 
      sheep red blood cell (SRBC), and at 42 days of age for biochemical analysis. 
      Supplementing 2% milk kefir increased body weight of broilers at 28 and 42 days of 
      age (P < 0.05). Supplementing 2% molasses kefir improved feed conversation ratio 
      (FCR) of broilers during growth period (P < 0.05), but FCR of broilers in other 
      periods was not affected. Daily feed intake, internal organ weights, and carcass 
      traits were not influenced by the treatments except for small intestine and ceca 
      length. Small intestinal length significantly decreased in broilers supplemented 
      with milk and molasses kefir (P < 0.05). Molasses kefir supplementation 
      significantly (P < 0.05) increased antibody titer against SRBC at 31 days of age but 
      other immune related parameters were not statistically different among treatments. 
      Biochemical parameters including serum protein, albumin, and triglyceride 
      concentrations were not statistically (P > 0.05) influenced. Broilers supplemented 
      with molasses kefir, had a significantly lower concentration of serum total 
      cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated high density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol at 42 days of age (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the results 
      indicated that inclusion of 2% milk kefir in drinking water would improve growth 
      performance of broiler chickens.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to understand the significance of each microorganism 
      in grain formation by evaluating their microbial aggregation and cell surface 
      properties during co-aggregation of LAB and yeasts together with an investigation of 
      biofilm formation. Non-grain forming strains from viili were also evaluated as a 
      comparison. Results indicated that the kefir grain strains, Lactobacillus 
      kefiranofaciens and Saccharomyces turicensis possess strong auto-aggregation ability 
      and that Lactobacillus kefiri shows significant biofilm formation properties. 
      Significant co-aggregation was noted when S. turicensis and kefir LAB strains (Lb. 
      kefiranofaciens and Lb. kefiri) were co-cultured. Most of the tested LAB strains are 
      hydrophilic and had a negative charge on their cell surface. Only the kefir LAB 
      strains, Lb. kefiranofaciens HL1 and Lb. kefiri HL2, possessed very high 
      hydrophobicity and had a positive cell surface charge at pH 4.2. In contrast, the 
      LAB and yeasts in viili did not show any significant self-aggregation or biofilm 
      formation. Based on the above results, we propose that grain formation begins with 
      the self-aggregation of Lb. kefiranofaciens and S. turicensis to form small 
      granules. At this point, the biofilm producer, Lb. kefiri, then begins to attach to 
      the surface of granules and co-aggregates with other organisms and components in the 
      milk to form the grains. On sub-culturing, more organisms attach to the grains 
      resulting in grain growth. When investigated by scanning electron microscopy, it was 
      found that short-chain lactobacilli such as Lb. kefiri occupy the surface, while 
      long-chain lactobacilli such as Lb. kefiranofaciens have aggregated towards the 
      center of the kefir grains. These findings agree with the above hypothesis on the 
      formation of grains. Taken together, this study demonstrates the importance of cell 
      surface properties together with fermentation conditions to the formation of grains 
      in kefir.

TI  - Kefir consumption does not alter plasma lipid levels or cholesterol fractional 
      synthesis rates relative to milk in hyperlipidemic men: a randomized controlled 
      trial [ISRCTN10820810].
PG  - 1
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fermented milk products have been shown to affect serum cholesterol 
      concentrations in humans. Kefir, a fermented milk product, has been traditionally 
      consumed for its potential health benefits but has to date not been studied for its 
      hypocholesterolemic properties. METHODS: Thirteen healthy mildly 
      hypercholesterolemic male subjects consumed a dairy supplement in randomized 
      crossover trial for 2 periods of 4 wk each. Subjects were blinded to the dairy 
      supplement consumed. Blood samples were collected at baseline and after 4 wk of 
      supplementation for measurement of plasma total, low-density lipoprotein, and 
      high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, as well as 
      fatty acid profile and cholesterol synthesis rate. Fecal samples were collected at 
      baseline and after 2 and 4 wk of supplementation for determination of fecal short 
      chain fatty acid level and bacterial content. RESULTS: Kefir had no effect on total 
      cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol or triglyceride concentrations nor on cholesterol fractional synthesis 
      rates after 4 wk of supplementation. No significant change on plasma fatty acid 
      levels was observed with diet. However, both kefir and milk increased (p < 0.05) 
      fecal isobutyric, isovaleric and propionic acids as well as the total amount of 
      fecal short chain fatty acids. Kefir supplementation resulted in increased fecal 
      bacterial content in the majority of the subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Since kefir 
      consumption did not result in lowered plasma lipid concentrations, the results of 
      this study do not support consumption of kefir as a cholesterol-lowering agent.

TI  - Surface proteins from Lactobacillus kefir antagonize in vitro cytotoxic effect of 
      Clostridium difficile toxins.
PG  - 135-42
LID - 10.1016/j.anaerobe.2011.11.002 [doi]
AB  - In this work, the ability of S-layer proteins from kefir-isolated Lactobacillus 
      kefir strains to antagonize the cytophatic effects of toxins from Clostridium 
      difficile (TcdA and TcdB) on eukaryotic cells in vitro was tested by cell detachment 
      assay. S-layer proteins from eight different L. kefir strains were able to inhibit 
      the damage induced by C. difficile spent culture supernatant to Vero cells. Besides, 
      same protective effect was observed by F-actin network staining. S-layer proteins 
      from aggregating L. kefir strains (CIDCA 83115, 8321, 8345 and 8348) showed a higher 
      inhibitory ability than those belonging to non-aggregating ones (CIDCA 83111, 83113, 
      JCM 5818 and ATCC 8007), suggesting that differences in the structure could be 
      related to the ability to antagonize the effect of clostridial toxins. Similar 
      results were obtained using purified TcdA and TcdB. Protective effect was not 
      affected by proteases inhibitors or heat treatment, thus indicating that proteolytic 
      activity is not involved. Only preincubation with specific anti-S-layer antibodies 
      significantly reduced the inhibitory effect of S-layer proteins, suggesting that 
      this could be attributed to a direct interaction between clostridial toxins and L. 
      kefir S-layer protein. Interestingly, the interaction of toxins with S-layer 
      carrying bacteria was observed by dot blot and fluorescence microscopy with specific 
      anti-TcdA or anti-TcdB antibodies, although L. kefir cells did not show protective 
      effects. We hypothesize that the interaction between clostridial toxins and soluble 
      S-layer molecules is different from the interaction with S-layer on the surface of 
      the bacteria thus leading a different ability to antagonize cytotoxic effect. This 
      is the first report showing the ability of S-layer proteins from kefir lactobacilli 
      to antagonize biological effects of bacterial toxins. These results encourage 
      further research on the role of bacterial surface molecules to the probiotic 
      properties of L. kefir and could contribute to strain selection with potential 
      therapeutic or prophylactic benefits towards CDAD.

PG  - 3234-42
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.6b00730 [doi]
AB  - Kefir is a traditional fermented milk beverage used throughout the world for 
      centuries. A cell-penetrating peptide, F3, was isolated from kefir by Sephadex G-50 
      gel filtration, DEAE-52 ion exchange, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid 
      chromatography. F3 was determined to be a low molecular weight peptide containing 
      one leucine and one tyrosine with two phosphate radicals. This peptide displayed 
      antimicrobial activity across a broad spectrum of organisms including several 
      Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungi, with minimal inhibitory 
      concentration (MIC) values ranging from 125 to 500 μg/mL. Cellular penetration and 
      accumulation of F3 were determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The 
      peptide was able to penetrate the cellular membrane of Escherichia coli and 
      Staphylococcus aureus. Changes in cell morphology were observed by scanning electron 
      microscopy (SEM). The results indicate that peptide F3 may be a good candidate for 
      use as an effective biological preservative in agriculture and the food industry.

AB  - Lifeway(®) kefir, a fermented milk product containing 12 probiotic organisms, is 
      reported to show promise as an alternative to fecal microbiota transplantation for 
      recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). We employed a murine CDI model to 
      study the probiotic protective mechanisms and unexpectedly determined that kefir 
      drastically increased disease severity. Our results emphasize the need for further 
      independent clinical testing of kefir as alternative therapy in recurrent CDI.

AB  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens is an indicator microorganism for kefir and a key 
      factor in kefir grain formation and kefiran production. We designed a novel 
      real-time PCR primer and probe set, LKF_KU504, for the rapid detection of L. 
      kefiranofaciens. In inclusivity and exclusivity tests, only 14 L. kefiranofaciens 
      strains were positive among 61 microorganisms, indicating 100 % sensitivity and 
      specificity. The LKF_KU504 set also differentiated kefir milk from 30 commercial 
      nonkefir yogurts. The levels of L. kefiranofaciens in kefir grain and kefir milk 
      were significantly different, indicating L. kefiranofaciens was more concentrated in 
      kefir grain than in kefir milk.

TI  - Comparative study of Kefir yogurt-drink and sodium fluoride mouth rinse on salivary 
      mutans streptococci.
PG  - 214-7
AB  - AIM: The level of mutans streptococci (MS) is reduced by regularly consumption of 
      probiotic Kefir drink. The present study aiming at answer to this question 'may the 
      Kefir drink be considered an alternative to fluoride rinse?' MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Twenty-two healthy volunteers aged 22-32 years with good oral hygiene participated 
      in this study. None of participants had received any antibiotic or antimicrobial 
      agent or professional fluoride therapy within the last month. None of them exhibited 
      active caries lesions. Smokers and subjects who have chewing gums xylitol habit or 
      who were undergoing orthodontic treatment were excluded. In a cross over design with 
      2 parallel groups, people in group A for 2 weeks received 100 ml of Kefir drink per 
      day, then avoided brushing, eating and drinking for an hour. Simultaneously, people 
      in group B were administered 0.05% sodium fluoride rinse in the same manner. After 
      washout period, people in groups A and B respectively used 0.05% sodium fluoride 
      rinse and Kefir drink. Saliva sampling was performed before and after interventions. 
      The acidity and the count of MS were assessed and data were analyzed statistically. 
      RESULT: There was no significant difference between base line pH values of saliva in 
      study groups (p > 0.05). Although, a significant difference was shown between MS 
      counts before and after interventions (p ≤ 0.0001 and p ≤ 0.0001 for NaF and Kefir 
      respectively), but the equal inhibitory effect was found between study groups (p > 
      0.05). CONCLUSION: Kefir drink can inhibit salivary MS as well the sodium fluoride 
      rinse. This beverage may be considered an alternative for fluoride rinse. Clinical 
      significance: Probiotics containing dairy products was known with anticariogenic 
      properties. These agents may be used in caries control strategies adjunctively.

TI  - Polysaccharide production by kefir grains during whey fermentation.
PG  - 653-61
AB  - Fermentation of deproteinised whey with kefir grains CIDCA AGK1 was studied focusing 
      on polysaccharide production from lactose. Kefir grains were able to acidify whey at 
      different rates depending on the grain/whey ratio. During fermentation, kefir grains 
      increased their weight and a water-soluble polysaccharide was released to the media. 
      Exopolysaccharide concentration increased with fermentation time, reaching values of 
      57.2 and 103.4 mg/l after 5 days of fermentation in cultures with 10 and 100 g kefir 
      grains/l, respectively. The polysaccharide fraction quantified after fermentation 
      corresponded to the soluble fraction, because part of the polysaccharide became a 
      component of the grain. Weight of kefir grains varied depending on the time of 
      fermentation. Polysaccharide production was affected by temperature. Although the 
      highest concentration of polysaccharide in the media was observed at 43 degrees C at 
      both grain/whey ratios, the weight of the grains decreased in these conditions. In 
      conclusion, kefir grains were able to acidify deproteinised whey, reducing lactose 
      concentration, increasing their weight and producing a soluble polysaccharide.

TI  - Interaction of S-layer proteins of Lactobacillus kefir with model membranes and 
      cells.
PG  - 117-125
LID - 10.1080/08982104.2017.1281950 [doi]
AB  - In previous works, it was shown that S-layer proteins from Lactobacillus kefir were 
      able to recrystallize and stabilize liposomes, this feature reveling a great 
      potential for developing liposomal-based carriers. Despite previous studies on this 
      subject are important milestones, a number of questions remain unanswered. In this 
      context, the feasibility of S-layer proteins as a biomaterial for drug delivery was 
      evaluated in this work. First, S-layer proteins were fully characterized by electron 
      microscopy, 2D-electrophoresis, and anionic exchange chromatography coupled with 
      pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD). Afterward, interactions of S-layer 
      proteins with model lipid membranes were evaluated, showing that proteins adsorb to 
      the lipid surface following a non-fickean or anomalous diffusion, when positively 
      charged lipid were employed, suggesting that electrostatic interaction is a key 
      factor in the recrystallization process on these proteins. Finally, the interaction 
      of S-layer coated liposomes with Caco-2 cell line was assessed: First, cytotoxicity 
      of formulations was tested showing no cytotoxic effects in S-layer coated vesicles. 
      Second, by flow cytometry, it was observed an increased ability to transfer cargo 
      molecules into Caco-2 cells from S-layer coated liposomes in comparison to control 
      ones. All data put together, supports the idea that a combination of adhesive 
      properties of S-layer proteins concomitant with higher stability of S-layer coated 
      liposomes represents an exciting starting point in the development of new drug 
      carriers.

TI  - Evaluation of quality of kefir from milk obtained from goats supplemented with a 
      diet rich in bioactive compounds.
PG  - 1343-9
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.6828 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The composition of bioactive components in dairy products depends on 
      their content in raw milk and the processing conditions. The experimental material 
      consisted of the milk of dairy goats supplemented with 120 g d(-1) per head of false 
      flax cake. The aim of the study was to evaluate the quality of kefir produced from 
      goat's milk with a higher content of bioactive components resulting from 
      supplementation of the goats' diet with false flax cake. RESULTS: The administration 
      of false flax cake to goats had a positive effect on the fatty acid profile of the 
      raw milk, causing an increase in the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids 
      (PUFA), including conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and n-3 fatty acids. Their 
      increased percentage was detected in the kefir after production as well as after 
      storage. The processing value of the harvested milk did not differ from the 
      qualitative characteristics of milk from goats of the control group. Increasing the 
      proportion of bioactive components in goat's milk did not result in changes in the 
      acidity, texture, colour, flavour, aroma or consistency of the kefir obtained. 
      CONCLUSION: Milk and kefir obtained after the administration of false flax cake to 
      goats contain bioactive components (PUFA including CLA, n-3 and monoenic trans fatty 
      acids) in significant amounts. Kefir from experimental goat's milk did not differ in 
      quality from kefir made from the milk of the control group.

AB  - Kefir is produced through the fermentation of milk using kefir grain as a starter 
      culture. Kefir grains include heterogeneous microorganisms embedded in a 
      polysaccharide matrix called kefiran which is considered a biofilm; it also has many 
      uses due to its therapeutic values. Kefiran is a microbial exopolysaccharide (EPS) 
      obtained from the flora (acid-lactic bacteria and yeasts) of kefir grains and 
      glucose units, in almost the same proportion. Kefiran has prebiotic nature agitating 
      the growth of probiotics in the gastrointestinal tract of the human entity. It 
      extends certain therapeutic benefits by balancing the microbiota in the intestine. 
      This review presents the most recent advances regarding kefir and kefiran, their 
      cultural condition, biological activities, and potential applications in the health 
      and food industries.

AB  - Kefir is a microbial symbiont mixture that produces jelly-like grains. As a widely 
      used neutraceutical, however, the therapeutic applicability of kefir is not certain. 
      In order to investigate the pharmacological effects of kefir, we used a mouse asthma 
      model, in which airway inflammation and airway remodeling was produced by ovalbumin 
      sensitization and challenge. BALB/c mice sensitized and challenged to ovalbumin, 
      were treated with kefir (50mg/kg administered by intra-gastric mode) 1h before the 
      ovalbumin challenge. Kefir significantly suppressed ovalbumin-induced airway 
      hyper-responsiveness (AHR) to inhaled methacholine. Intra-gastric administration of 
      kefir significantly inhibited the increase in the total inflammatory cell count 
      induced by ovalbumin, and the eosinophil count in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 
      (BALF). Type 2 helper T cell (Th2) cytokines, such as interleukin-4 and 
      interleukin-13, and total immunoglobulin E (Ig E) levels, were also reduced to 
      normal levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Histological studies demonstrate that 
      kefir substantially inhibited ovalbumin-induced eosinophilia in lung tissue and 
      mucus hyper-secretion by goblet cells in the airway. Kefir displayed 
      anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects in a mouse asthma model and may possess 
      new therapeutic potential for the treatment of allergic bronchial asthma.

AB  - Brazilian kefir is a homemade fermented beverage that is obtained by incubating milk 
      or a brown sugar solution with kefir grains that contribute their different 
      microbiological compositions. It is highly important to isolate and characterize 
      microorganisms from Brazilian kefir grains to obtain starter cultures for the 
      industrial production of a standardized commercial kefir. Thus, the present study 
      aimed to isolate lactic acid bacteria from eight kefir grains that were propagated 
      in milk or sugar solutions from five different locations in Brazil and to select 
      Lactobacillus isolates based on desirable in vitro probiotic properties. One hundred 
      eight isolates from both substrates were identified by amplified ribosomal DNA 
      restriction analysis and/or 16S rRNA gene sequencing and were determined to belong 
      to the following 11 species from the genera: Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus 
      (L.), and Oenococcus. Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus kefiri, and 
      Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens were isolated only from milk grains, whereas 
      Lactobacillus perolens, Lactobacillus parafarraginis, Lactobacillus diolivorans, and 
      Oenococcus oeni were isolated exclusively from sugar water grains. When the 
      microbial compositions of four kefir grains were evaluated with culture-independent 
      analyses, L. kefiranofaciens was observed to predominant in milk grains, whereas 
      Lactobacillus hilgardii was most abundant in sugar water kefir. Unfortunately, L. 
      hilgardii was not isolated from any grain, although this bacteria was detected with 
      a culture-independent methodology. Fifty-two isolated Lactobacilli were tested for 
      gastric juice and bile salt tolerance, antagonism against pathogens, antimicrobial 
      resistance, and surface hydrophobicity. Three Lactobacillus strains (L. 
      kefiranofaciens 8U, L. diolivorans 1Z, and Lactobacillus casei 17U) could be 
      classified as potential probiotics. In conclusion, several lactic acid bacteria that 
      could be used in combination with yeasts as starter cultures for both milk kefir and 
      sugar water kefir were characterized, and the functional properties of several of 
      the lactobacilli isolated from the kefir grains were suggestive of their possible 
      use as probiotics in both kefir and other dairy products.

TI  - Inhibition of Bacillus cereus in milk fermented with kefir grains.
PG  - 2613-6
AB  - The effects of kefir-fermented milk were tested against a toxigenic strain of 
      Bacillus cereus. The incubation of milk with B. cereus spores plus 5% kefir grains 
      prevented spore germination and growth of vegetative forms. In contrast, when 1% 
      kefir grains was used, no effects were observed. The presence of metabolically 
      active kefir grains diminished titers of nonhemolytic enterotoxin A, as assessed by 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. During fermentation, kefir microorganisms produce 
      extracellular metabolites such as organic acids, which could play a role in the 
      inhibition of spore germination and growth of B. cereus, although the effect of 
      other factors cannot be ruled out. Results of the present study show that 
      kefir-fermented milk is able to antagonize key mechanisms involved in the growth of 
      B. cereus as well as interfere with the biological activity of this microorganism.

AB  - The microbiological and chemical characteristics as well as organic and amino acid 
      profiles of kefir samples made from cow and buffalo milks fermented by kefir grains 
      and starter culture were investigated during storage for 21 d at 4°C. After 
      incubation, lactic, acetic, and citric acid concentrations showed a difference among 
      the samples due to milk type and production methods. Storage time had little effect 
      on the organic acid values of kefir samples. As compared with cow milk kefir, 
      buffalo milk kefir had higher numbers of microorganisms, except lactobacilli, at the 
      end of storage. Whereas pH and titratable acidity exhibited similar changes during 
      storage in all kefir samples, ethanol levels were significantly increased in buffalo 
      milk kefir samples. Glutamic acid was the major amino acid at all sampling times for 
      all samples. Tyrosine, serine, histidine, alanine, methionine, and lysine 
      concentrations were determined to be different in all samples depending on milk 
      type. In general, due to the higher microbial population (especially yeast), kefir 
      made from buffalo milk may be preferred.

AB  - Kefir is a functional dairy product and the effects of kefir consumption on health 
      have been well documented. Kefir grains have naturally high numbers of lactic acid 
      bacteria and yeasts and are used in manufacturing kefir. The biomass of kefir grains 
      slowly increases after successive fermentations. The effects of adding whey protein 
      isolate, modified whey protein (MWP, fat replacer; Carbery Inc., Cork, Ireland), or 
      inulin to milk and different atmospheric conditions (ambient or 6% CO(2)) during 
      fermentation on the increase in biomass of kefir grains were investigated. 
      Reconstituted milks (10% milk powder) enriched with whey protein isolate (2%), MWP 
      (2%), and inulin (2%) were inoculated with kefir grains and fermented in ambient and 
      6% CO(2) incubators at 25°C until a final pH of 4.6 was reached. Biomass increments 
      of kefir grains were determined weekly over 30 d. Lactic acid bacteria and yeast 
      contents of kefir grains were also determined. The highest biomass increase (392%) 
      was found in kefir grains grown in milk supplemented with whey protein isolate under 
      ambient atmospheric conditions. Application of CO(2) did not provide a significant 
      supporting effect on the biomass of kefir grains. Addition of MWP significantly 
      accelerated the formation of kefir grain biomass (223%). The use of whey protein 
      isolate, MWP, or inulin in milk did not cause any adverse effects on the microbial 
      flora of kefir grains.

AB  - Stability in gut ecosystems is an important area of study that impacts on the use of 
      additives and is related with several pathologies. Kefir is a fermented milk drink 
      made with a consortium of yeast and bacteria as a fermentation starter, of which the 
      use as additive in companion and livestock animals has increased in the last few 
      years. To investigate the effect of kefir milk on foregut and hindgut digestive 
      systems, an in vitro approach was followed. Either rumen fluid or horse fecal 
      contents were used as a microbial inoculate and the inclusion of kefir (fresh, 
      autoclaved, or pasteurized) was tested. Gas production over 72 h of incubation was 
      recorded and pH, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), lactate and ammonia concentration as 
      well as lactic acid (LAB) and acetic acid bacteria, and yeast total numbers were 
      also measured. Both direct and indirect (by subtracting their respective blanks) 
      effects were analyzed and a multivariate analysis was performed to compare foregut 
      and hindgut fermentation models. Addition of kefir boosted the fermentation by 
      increasing molar concentration of VFAs and ammonia and shifting the Acetate to 
      Propionate ratio in both models but heat processing techniques like pasteurization 
      or autoclaving influenced the way the kefir is fermented and reacts with the present 
      microbiota. In terms of comparison between both models, the foregut model seems to 
      be less affected by the inclusion of Kefir than the hindgut model. In terms of 
      variability in the response, the hindgut model appeared to be more variable than the 
      foregut model in the way that it reacted indirectly to the addition of different 
      types of kefir.

AB  - Kefir is a fermented dairy product, associated to health benefits because of being a 
      probiotic and due to the presence of molecules with biological activity. In this 
      work, we have profiled the peptide composition of goat milk kefir at three different 
      fermentation times using a peptidomics approach, in order to study changes in 
      peptide concentrations and patterns of protein digestion throughout the fermentation 
      time. We identified 2328 unique peptides corresponding to 22 protein annotations, 
      with a maximum of peptides found after 24 h fermentation. We established different 
      digestion patterns according to the nature of the proteins, and quantified the 
      changes in the peptides appearing in all the fermentation times. We also identified 
      11 peptides that matched exactly to sequences with biological activity in databases, 
      almost all of them belonging to caseins. This is the most comprehensive proteomic 
      analysis of goat milk kefir to date.

AB  - This study was designed to determine whether kefir accentuates the positive health 
      benefits assessed by measures in fitness, body composition, or both, as a measure of 
      cardiovascular disease risk as well as the biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP). 
      Sixty-seven adult males and females aged 18 to 24 yr were assigned to 1 of 4 groups: 
      (1) endurance training + control beverage, (2) endurance training +kefir 
      beverage,(3) active control + control beverage, or (4) active control + kefir 
      beverage. The exercise groups completed 15 wk of structured endurancetraining while 
      the active control groups maintained their usual exercise routine. Additionally, 
      each group was assigned to either a kefir or a calorie/macronutrient matched placebo 
      beverage that was consumed twice per week. No significant interactions were found 
      among groups with respect to outcome variables with the exception of serum CRP. The 
      endurance training was effective in improving 1.5-mile (2.41 km) times and kefir 
      supplementation may have been a factor in attenuating the increase in CRP that was 
      observed over the course of the intervention period. This preliminary study suggests 
      that kefir may be involved in improving the risk profile for cardiovascular disease 
      as defined by CRP.

PG  - 136-40
AB  - AIMS: In this work the microflora present in kefir, a fermented milk product, was 
      studied together with the effect of kefir administration on different groups of 
      indigenous bacteria of mouse bowel. METHODS AND RESULTS: Kefir microflora was 
      composed of lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria and yeasts. Yeast population 
      was composed of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, S. unisporus, Candida kefir, Kluyveromyces 
      marxianus and K. lactis. The streptococci levels in kefir treated mice increased by 
      10-fold and the levels of sulfite-reducing clostridia decreased by 100-fold. The 
      number of lactic acid bacteria increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      administration of kefir significantly increased the lactic acid bacteria counts in 
      the mucosa of the bowel. Ingestion of kefir specifically lowered microbial 
      populations of Enterobacteriaceae and clostridia. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE 
      STUDY: This is the first long-term study about the effects of the kefir 
      administration on the intestinal microflora of mice.

TI  - Protective effects of the fermented milk Kefir on X-ray irradiation-induced 
      intestinal damage in B6C3F1 mice.
PG  - 352-9
AB  - Gastrointestinal damage associated with radiation therapy is currently an inevitable 
      outcome. The protective effect of Kefir was assessed for its usefulness against 
      radiation-induced gastrointestinal damage. A Kefir supernatant was diluted by 2- or 
      10-fold and administered for 1 week prior to 8 Gray (Gy) X-ray irradiation at a dose 
      rate of 2 Gy/min, with an additional 15 d of administration post-irradiation. The 
      survival rate of control mice with normal drinking water dropped to 70% on days 4 
      through 9 post-irradiation. On the other hand, 100% of mice in the 10- and 
      2-fold-diluted Kefir groups survived up to day 9 post-irradiation (p<0.05 and 
      p<0.01, respectively). Examinations for crypt regeneration against 8, 10 and 12 Gy 
      irradiation at a dose rate of 4 Gy/min revealed that the crypt number was 
      significantly increased in the mice administered both diluted Kefir solutions 
      (p<0.01 for each). Histological and immunohistochemical examinations revealed that 
      the diluted Kefir solutions protected the crypts from radiation, and promoted crypt 
      regeneration. In addition, lyophilized Kefir powder was found to significantly 
      recover the testis weights (p<0.05), but had no effects on the body and spleen 
      weights, after 8 Gy irradiation. These findings suggest that Kefir could be a 
      promising candidate as a radiation-protective agent.

      industrial water kefir fermentation process.
PG  - 2811-2819
LID - 10.1007/s00253-016-8084-5 [doi]
AB  - A poorly performing industrial water kefir production process consisting of a first 
      fermentation process, a rest period at low temperature, and a second fermentation 
      process was characterized to elucidate the causes of its low water kefir grain 
      growth and instability. The frozen-stored water kefir grain inoculum was thawed and 
      reactivated during three consecutive prefermentations before the water kefir 
      production process was started. Freezing and thawing damaged the water kefir grains 
      irreversibly, as their structure did not restore during the prefermentations nor the 
      production process. The viable counts of the lactic acid bacteria and yeasts on the 
      water kefir grains and in the liquors were as expected, whereas those of the acetic 
      acid bacteria were high, due to the aerobic fermentation conditions. Nevertheless, 
      the fermentations progressed slowly, which was caused by excessive substrate 
      concentrations resulting in a high osmotic stress. Lactobacillus nagelii, 
      Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus hilgardii, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 
      Bifidobacterium aquikefiri, Gluconobacter roseus/oxydans, Gluconobacter cerinus, 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Zygotorulaspora florentina were the most prevalent 
      microorganisms. Lb. hilgardii, the microorganism thought to be responsible for water 
      kefir grain growth, was not found culture-dependently, which could explain the low 
      water kefir grain growth of this industrial process.

      CIDCA83123 and CIDCA83124 were analyzed. The three strains produced bioactive 
      metabolites during fermentation, since the fermented milk supernatants were able to 
      downregulate >75% of the induced innate immune response in vitro. Although all 
      strains presented absence of hemolytic activity and susceptibility to antibiotics, 
      L. paracasei CIDCA8339 presented more attractive probiotic and technological 
      properties. Mice consuming the fermented milk with L. paracasei CIDCA 8339 did not 
      present significant modifications in sIgA levels or TNF-α, TGF-β and IL-10 mRNA 
      expression in ileum. Additionally, a decrease of INF-γ level in ileum and no 
      microbiological translocation to liver and spleen was observed. These results 
      demonstrate that L. paracasei CIDCA8339 represents a safe promising potential 
      probiotic strain for the development of functional foods.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of thermally-dried immobilized 
      kefir on casein as a starter culture for protein-enriched dried whey cheese. For 
      comparison reasons, dried whey cheese with thermally-dried free kefir culture and 
      with no starter culture were also produced. The effect of the nature of the culture, 
      the ripening temperature and the ripening process on quality characteristics of the 
      whey cheese was studied. The association of microbial groups during cheese 
      maturation suggested repression of spoilage and protection from pathogens due to the 
      thermally-dried kefir, as counts of coliforms, enterobacteria and staphylococci were 
      significantly reduced in cheeses produced using thermally-dried kefir starter 
      cultures. The effect of the starter culture on production of volatile compounds 
      responsible for cheese flavor was also studied using the SPME GC/MS technique. 
      Thermally-dried immobilized kefir starter culture resulted in an improved profile of 
      aroma-related compounds. The preliminary sensory evaluation ascertained the soft, 
      fine taste and the overall improved quality of cheese produced with the 
      thermally-dried immobilized kefir. The potential of protein-based thermally-dried 
      starter cultures in dairy products is finally highlighted and assessed.

TI  - Evaluation of freeze-dried kefir coculture as starter in feta-type cheese 
      production.
PG  - 6124-35
AB  - The use of freeze-dried kefir coculture as a starter in the production of feta-type 
      cheese was investigated. Maturation of the produced cheese at 4 degrees C was 
      monitored for up to 70 days, and the effects of the starter culture, the salting 
      method, and the ripening process on quality characteristics were studied. The use of 
      kefir coculture as a starter led to increased lactic acid concentrations and 
      decreased pH values in the final product associated with significantly higher 
      conversion rates compared to salted rennet cheese. Determination of bacterial 
      diversity at the end of the ripening process in salted kefir and rennet cheeses by 
      denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technology, based on both DNA and RNA 
      analyses, suggested a potential species-specific inhibition of members of the genera 
      Staphylococcus and Psychrobacter by kefir coculture. The main active microbial 
      associations in salted kefir cheese appeared to be members of the genera Pseudomonas 
      and Lactococcus, while in salted rennet cheese, Oxalobacteraceae, Janthinobacterium, 
      Psychrobacter, and Pseudomonas species were noted. The effect of the starter culture 
      on the production of aroma-related compounds responsible for cheese flavor was also 
      studied by the solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry 
      technique. Kefir coculture also appeared to extend the shelf life of unsalted 
      cheese. Spoilage of kefir cheese was observed on the 9th and 20th days of 
      preservation at 10 and 5 degrees C, respectively, while spoilage in the 
      corresponding rennet cheese was detected on the 7th and 16th days. Microbial counts 
      during preservation of both types of unsalted cheese increased steadily and reached 
      similar levels, with the exception of staphylococci, which were significantly lower 
      in unsalted kefir cheese. All types of cheese produced with kefir as a starter were 
      approved and accepted by the panel during the preliminary sensory evaluation 
      compared to commercial feta-type cheese.

AB  - Kefir is a type of fermented milk containing lactic and acetic acid bacteria and 
      yeast. In this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of kefir supernatant 
      against Cronobacter sakazakii in powdered infant formula (PIF). In a spot-on-lawn 
      test, the growth of 20 C. sakazakii strains, including 10 clinical and 10 food 
      isolates, was completely inhibited in the presence of kefir supernatant. Significant 
      differences in the diameters of inhibition zones were observed upon treatment with 
      kefir compared with the results for Lactobacillus kefiri and Candida kefyr culture 
      supernatants or solutions of lactic and acetic acid and ethyl alcohol in the agar 
      well diffusion test (P < 0.05). The addition of 100 μl of kefir supernatant to 1 ml 
      of nutrient broth completely inhibited the growth of C. sakazakii, as evaluated by 
      spectrophotometry. The antimicrobial activity of kefir supernatant in experimentally 
      contaminated PIF was also tested; we found no viable C. sakazakii cells remaining in 
      PIF rehydrated with 30% kefir supernatant solution for 1 h, demonstrating that the 
      antimicrobial activity of kefir supernatant against C. sakazakii could be applied in 
      real food samples.

AB  - Kefir is a fermented milk traditionally made from a unique starter culture, which 
      consists of numerous bacteria and yeast species bound together in an 
      exopolysaccharide matrix produced by certain lactic acid bacteria. Many health 
      benefits are associated with traditionally produced kefir; however, bulging and 
      leaking packaging, caused by secondary yeast fermentation during storage, has 
      limited large-scale manufacture. Commercial kefir products have been designed to 
      reduce these effects by using a pure starter culture consisting of a mixture of 
      bacteria and yeast species that give a flavor similar to traditional kefir, but some 
      health benefits may be lost in commercial production due to reduced microbial 
      diversity and lack of beneficial exopolysaccharides. In this study, traditional and 
      commercial kefir was frozen to study the effects of frozen storage on the viability 
      of probiotic bacteria over time. Traditional kefir was prepared by inoculating 1L of 
      pasteurized whole goat milk with approximately 30g of kefir grains. Commercial kefir 
      was prepared by inoculating 1L of full-fat, pasteurized goat milk with a commercial 
      kefir starter. The milk was allowed to ferment at room temperature (24-28°C) until 
      pH 4.6 was reached. Samples were frozen (-8 to -14°C) immediately following the 
      completion of fermentation and were thawed and plated for lactobacilli, lactococci, 
      and yeasts on d 0, 7, 14, and 30 of frozen storage. Lactobacilli, lactococci, and 
      yeasts were significantly reduced in number during frozen storage; however, the 
      traditionally produced kefir was shown to have significantly higher counts of 
      bacteria and yeast at each sampling. We concluded that frozen storage and the 
      development of frozen kefir products could eliminate most packaging concerns 
      associated with the large-scale manufacture of traditionally produced kefir, 
      resulting in increased production and marketability of this healthful product.

AB  - The aim of this study was to increase rhamnolipid production by formulating media 
      using kefir and fish meal for Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from different 
      environmental resources. The strains, named as H1, SY1, and ST1, capable of 
      rhamnolipid production were isolated from soil contaminated with wastes originating 
      from olive and fish oil factories. Additionally, P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027 strain, 
      which is known as rhamnolipid producer, was included in the study. Initially, 
      rhamnolipid production by the strains was determined in Mineral Salt Medium (MSM) 
      and then in media prepared by using kefir and fish meal. The obtained rhamnolipids 
      were purified and quantified according to Dubois et al. (1956). The quantity of 
      rhamnolipids of ATCC, H1 and SY1 strains in kefir media were determined as 11.7 g/L, 
      10.8 g/L and 3.2 g/L, respectively, and in fish meal media as 12.3 g/L, 9.3 g/L and 
      10.3 g/L, respectively. In addition, effect of UV light exposure on rhamnolipid 
      production was also investigated but contrary a decrease was observed. The results 
      indicate that P. aeruginosa strains isolated from various environmental resources 
      used in this study can be important due to their rhamnolipid yield, and fish meal, 
      which is obtained from waste of fish, can be an alternative source in low cost 
      rhamnolipid production.

TI  - Mathematical model of CO(2) release during milk fermentation using natural kefir 
      grains.
PG  - 4680-4684
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.9001 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Milk fermentation takes place in the presence of various 
      micro-organisms, producing a variety of dairy products. The oldest of them is kefir, 
      which is usually produced by the fermentation of milk with kefir grains. Carbon 
      dioxide (CO(2) ), as one of the process products, also contributes to the 
      characteristic flavor of kefir. The amount of CO(2) generated during fermentation 
      depends on bioprocessing conditions and may change, which is not desirable at the 
      industrial level. RESULTS: In this study we developed a simplified mathematical 
      model of CO(2) release in the milk-fermentation process. An intuitive approach based 
      on superposition and experimental analysis was used for the modeling. The chemical 
      system studied was considered as a two-input (temperature, rotational frequency of 
      the stirrer) one-output (CO(2) concentration) dynamic system. CONCLUSION: Based on 
      an analysis of CO(2) release transients in the case of non-simultaneous stepwise 
      changed input quantities, two differential equations were defined that describe the 
      influence of the two input quantities on the output quantity. The simulation results 
      were verified by experiments. The proposed model can be used for a comprehensive 
      analysis of the process that is being studied and for the design and synthesis of 
      advanced control systems, which will ensure a controlled CO(2) release at the 
      industrial level. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry.

AB  - Kefir grains as a probiotic have been subject to microbial community identification 
      using culture-dependent and independent methods that target specific strains in the 
      community, or that are based on limited 16S rRNA analysis. We performed whole genome 
      shotgun pyrosequencing using two Turkish Kefir grains. Sequencing generated 
      3,682,455 high quality reads for a total of ∼1.6 Gbp of data assembled into 6151 
      contigs with a total length of ∼24 Mbp. Species identification mapped 88.16% and 
      93.81% of the reads rendering 4 Mpb of assembly that did not show any homology to 
      known bacterial sequences. Identified communities in the two grains showed high 
      concordance where Lactobacillus was the most abundant genus with a mapped abundance 
      of 99.42% and 99.79%. This genus was dominantly represented by three species 
      Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, Lactobacillus buchneri and Lactobacillus helveticus 
      with a total mapped abundance of 97.63% and 98.74%. We compared and verified our 
      findings with 16S pyrosequencing and model based 16S data analysis. Our results 
      suggest that microbial community profiling using whole genome shotgun data is 
      feasible, can identify novel species data, and has the potential to generate a more 
      accurate and detailed assessment of the underlying bacterial community, especially 
      for low abundance species.

TI  - Sequence-based analysis of the microbial composition of water kefir from multiple 
      sources.
PG  - 79-85
LID - 10.1111/1574-6968.12248 [doi]
AB  - Water kefir is a water-sucrose-based beverage, fermented by a symbiosis of bacteria 
      and yeast to produce a final product that is lightly carbonated, acidic and that has 
      a low alcohol percentage. The microorganisms present in water kefir are introduced 
      via water kefir grains, which consist of a polysaccharide matrix in which the 
      microorganisms are embedded. We aimed to provide a comprehensive sequencing-based 
      analysis of the bacterial population of water kefir beverages and grains, while 
      providing an initial insight into the corresponding fungal population. To facilitate 
      this objective, four water kefirs were sourced from the UK, Canada and the United 
      States. Culture-independent, high-throughput, sequencing-based analyses revealed 
      that the bacterial fraction of each water kefir and grain was dominated by 
      Zymomonas, an ethanol-producing bacterium, which has not previously been detected at 
      such a scale. The other genera detected were representatives of the lactic acid 
      bacteria and acetic acid bacteria. Our analysis of the fungal component established 
      that it was comprised of the genera Dekkera, Hanseniaspora, Saccharomyces, 
      Zygosaccharomyces, Torulaspora and Lachancea. This information will assist in the 
      ultimate identification of the microorganisms responsible for the potentially 
      health-promoting attributes of these beverages.

TI  - The evaluation of kefir pure culture starter: Liquid-core capsule entrapping 
      microorganisms isolated from kefir grains.
PG  - 598-608
AB  - The main purpose of this study was to develop a pure culture starter for producing 
      kefir. In order to accomplish starter recycling, yeasts (Kluyveromyces marxianus 
      strain, Pichia kudriavzevii clone), lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus kefiri 
      strain F4Aa, Lactobacillus kefiri strain NM131-7, Lactobacillus kefiri strain 
      NM132-3, Lactobacillus kefiri strain NM180-3, respectively), and acetic acid 
      bacteria (Acetobacter lovaniensis strain) were entrapped in liquid core capsules 
      based on the distribution ratio in kefir grains. The microbiological, antimicrobial, 
      and chemical properties of kefir made with capsules (M) and kefir grains (K) were 
      measured and compared. According to the results of plate counts in different 
      selective medium, the number of yeasts and bacteria in the liquid core capsules 
      gradually increased and stabilized after eight fermentation cycles. The results of 
      gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that almost all the aroma components 
      existed in the two type of kefir, except the ethyl lactate. There was no significant 
      difference in alcohol content, protein content, and fat content, except the acidity 
      and sugar content. Water holding capacity of kefir K was higher than kefir M. There 
      were 14 same free amino acids in kefir M and kefir K, and the content of most free 
      amino acids was similar. In antimicrobial test, there was no significant difference 
      in both kefirs.

TI  - Protective action of Lactobacillus kefir carrying S-layer protein against Salmonella 
      enterica serovar Enteritidis.
PG  - 264-73
AB  - Eight Lactobacillus kefir strains isolated from different kefir grains were tested 
      for their ability to antagonize Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (Salmonella 
      enteritidis) interaction with epithelial cells. L. kefir surface properties such as 
      autoaggregation and coaggregation with Salmonella and adhesion to Caco-2/TC-7 cells 
      were evaluated. L. kefir strains showed significantly different adhesion capacities, 
      six strains were able to autoaggregate and four strains coaggregated with 
      Salmonella. Coincubation of Salmonella with coaggregating L. kefir strains 
      significantly decreased its capacity to adhere to and to invade Caco-2/TC-7 cells. 
      This was not observed with non coaggregating L. kefir strains. Spent culture 
      supernatants of L. kefir contain significant amounts of S-layer proteins. Salmonella 
      pretreated with spent culture supernatants (pH 4.5-4.7) from all tested L. kefir 
      strains showed a significant decrease in association and invasion to Caco-2/TC-7 
      cells. Artificially acidified MRS containing lactic acid to a final concentration 
      and pH equivalent to lactobacilli spent culture supernatants did not show any 
      protective action. Pretreatment of this pathogen with spent culture supernatants 
      reduced microvilli disorganization produced by Salmonella. In addition, Salmonella 
      pretreated with S-layer proteins extracted from coaggregating and non coaggregating 
      L. kefir strains were unable to invade Caco-2/TC-7 cells. After treatment, L. kefir 
      S-layer protein was detected associated with Salmonella, suggesting a protective 
      role of this protein on association and invasion.

AB  - Abstract We aim to study the effect of low-dose aspirin and kefir on arterial blood 
      pressure measurements and renal apoptosis in unhypertensive rats with 4 weeks salt 
      diet. Forty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into five groups: control, 
      high-salt (HS) (8.0% NaCl), HS+aspirin (10 mg/kg), HS+kefir (10.0%w/v), 
      HS+aspirin +kefir. We measured sistolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial pressure 
      (MAP), diastolic pressure, pulse pressure in the rats. Cathepsin B, L, DNA 
      fragmentation and caspase-3 activities were determined from rat kidney tissues and 
      rats clearance of creatinine calculated. Although HS diet increased significantly 
      SBP, MAP, diastolic pressure, pulse pressure parameters compared the control values. 
      They were not as high as accepted hypertension levels. When compared to HS groups, 
      kefir groups significantly decrease Cathepsin B and DNA fragmentation levels. 
      Caspase levels were elevated slightly in other groups according to control group. 
      While, we also found that creatinine clearance was higher in HS+kefir and 
      HS+low-dose aspirin than HS group. Thus, using low-dose aspirin had been 
      approximately decreased of renal function damage. Kefir decreased renal function 
      damage playing as Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. But, low-dose aspirin 
      together with kefir worsened rat renal function damage. Cathepsin B might play role 
      both apoptosis and prorenin-processing enzyme. But not caspase pathway may be 
      involved in the present HS diet induced apoptosis. In conclusion, kefir and low-dose 
      aspirin used independently protect renal function and renal damage induced by HS 
      diet in rats.

AB  - Kefir is a fermented milk-based beverage to which a number of health-promoting 
      properties have been attributed. The microbes responsible for the fermentation of 
      milk to produce kefir consist of a complex association of bacteria and yeasts, bound 
      within a polysaccharide matrix, known as the kefir grain. The consistency of this 
      microbial population, and that present in the resultant beverage, has been the 
      subject of a number of previous, almost exclusively culture-based, studies which 
      have indicated differences depending on geographical location and culture 
      conditions. However, culture-based identification studies are limited by virtue of 
      only detecting species with the ability to grow on the specific medium used and thus 
      culture-independent, molecular-based techniques offer the potential for a more 
      comprehensive analysis of such communities. Here we describe a detailed 
      investigation of the microbial population, both bacterial and fungal, of kefir, 
      using high-throughput sequencing to analyse 25 kefir milks and associated grains 
      sourced from 8 geographically distinct regions. This is the first occasion that this 
      technology has been employed to investigate the fungal component of these 
      populations or to reveal the microbial composition of such an extensive number of 
      kefir grains or milks. As a result several genera and species not previously 
      identified in kefir were revealed. Our analysis shows that the bacterial populations 
      in kefir are dominated by 2 phyla, the Firmicutes and the Proteobacteria. It was 
      also established that the fungal populations of kefir were dominated by the genera 
      Kazachstania, Kluyveromyces and Naumovozyma, but that a variable sub-dominant 
      population also exists.

AB  - (S)-1-(2, 6-dichloro-3-fluorophenyl) ethanol, the key chiral intermediate of 
      crizotinib, was prepared from 1-(2, 6-dichloro-3-fluorophenyl) ethanone using the 
      alcohol dehydrogenases from Lactobacillus kefir (ADH-LK) with a tetrad mutant 
      (ADH-LKM, F147L/Y190P/V196L/A202W), coupled with glucose dehydrogenase (GDH). In the 
      present study, ADH-LKM and GDH were successfully heterologous expressed in 
      recombinant Escherichia coli. During the regeneration of NADPH with GDH, 150 g/L 
      substrate was totally transformed into target chiral alcohol with an enantiomeric 
      excess value of 99.9% after 12 h at 30 °C (pH 7.0). Our study demonstrates the 
      potential for industrial green production of the key chiral intermediate of 
      crizotinib.

TI  - Scale-up of thermally dried kefir production as starter culture for hard-type cheese 
      making: an economic evaluation.
PG  - 1734-43
LID - 10.1007/s12010-009-8645-5 [doi]
AB  - This paper concerns the effect of thermal-drying methodology on the investment cost 
      for dried kefir cells production in order to be used as starter culture in cheese 
      manufacturing. Kefir cells were produced at pilot plant scale using a 250-L 
      bioreactor and whey as the main substrate. Kefir cells were subsequently dried in a 
      thermal dryer at 38 degrees C and used as a starter culture in industrial-scale 
      production of hard-type cheeses. The use of thermally dried kefir as starter culture 
      accelerated ripening of cheeses by increasing both lipolysis and fermentation rate 
      as indicated by the ethanol, lactic acid, and glycerol formation. Additionally, it 
      reduced coliforms and enterobacteria as ripening proceeded. This constituted the 
      basis of developing an economic study in which industrial-scale production of 
      thermally dried kefir starter culture is discussed. The industrial design involved a 
      three-step process using three bioreactors of 100, 3,000, and 30,000 L for a plant 
      capacity of 300 kg of thermally dried kefir culture per day. The cost of investment 
      was estimated at 238,000 euro, which is the 46% of the corresponding cost using 
      freeze-drying methodology. Production cost was estimated at 4.9 euro/kg of kefir 
      biomass for a 300-kg/day plant capacity, which is the same as with the corresponding 
      cost of freeze-dried cells. However, the estimated added value is up to 10.8 x 10(9) 
      euro within the European Union.

AB  - Water kefir is a slightly alcoholic and traditionally fermented beverage, which is 
      prepared from sucrose, water, kefir grains, and dried or fresh fruits (e.g., figs). 
      Lactobacillus (L.) nagelii, L. hordei, and Saccharomyces (S.) cerevisiae are 
      predominant and stable lactic acid bacteria and yeasts, respectively, isolated from 
      water kefir consortia. The growth of L. nagelii and L. hordei are improved in the 
      presence of S. cerevisiae. In this work we demonstrate that quantitative comparative 
      proteomics enables the investigation of interactions between LAB and yeast to 
      predict real-time metabolic exchange in water kefir. It revealed 73 differentially 
      expressed (DE) in L. nagelii TMW 1.1827 in the presence of S. cerevisiae. The 
      presence of the yeast induced changes in the changes in the carbohydrate metabolism 
      of L. nagelii and affected reactions involved in NAD(+)/NADH homeostasis. 
      Furthermore, the DE enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis or catabolism 
      predict that S. cerevisiae releases glutamine, histidine, methionine, and arginine, 
      which are subsequently used by L. nagelii to ensure its survival in the water kefir 
      consortium. In co-culture with S. cerevisiae, L. nagelii profits from riboflavin, 
      most likely secreted by the yeast. The reaction of L. nagelii to the presence of S. 
      cerevisiae differs from that one of the previously studied L. hordei, which displays 
      233 differentially expressed proteins, changes in citrate metabolism and an 
      antidromic strategy for NAD(+)/NADH homeostasis. So far, aggregation promotion 
      factors, i.e., formation of a specific glucan and bifunctional enzymes were only 
      detected in L. hordei.

AB  - Milk kefir is produced by fermenting milk in the presence of kefir grains. This 
      beverage has several benefits for human health. The aim of this experiment was to 
      analyze 5 kefir grains (and their products) using a targeted metagenetic approach. 
      Of the 5 kefir grains analyzed, 1 was purchased in a supermarket, 2 were provided by 
      the Ministry of Agriculture (Namur, Belgium), and 2 were provided by individuals. 
      The metagenetic approach targeted the V1-V3 fragment of the 16S ribosomal (r)DNA for 
      the grains and the resulting beverages at 2 levels of grain incorporation (5 and 
      10%) to identify the bacterial species population. In contrast, the 26S rDNA 
      pyrosequencing was performed only on kefir grains with the aim of assessing the 
      yeast populations. In parallel, pH measurements were performed on the kefir obtained 
      from the kefir grains using 2 incorporation rates. Regarding the bacterial 
      population, 16S pyrosequencing revealed the presence of 20 main bacterial species, 
      with a dominance of the following: Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, Lactococcus lactis 
      ssp. cremoris, Gluconobacter frateurii, Lactobacillus kefiri, Acetobacter 
      orientalis, and Acetobacter lovaniensis. An important difference was noticed between 
      the kefir samples: kefir grain purchased from a supermarket (sample E) harbored a 
      much higher proportion of several operational taxonomic units of Lactococcus lactis 
      and Leuconostoc mesenteroides. This sample of grain was macroscopically different 
      from the others in terms of size, apparent cohesion of the grains, structure, and 
      texture, probably associated with a lower level of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. 
      The kefir (at an incorporation rate of 5%) produced from this sample of grain was 
      characterized by a lower pH value (4.5) than the others. The other 4 samples of 
      kefir (5%) had pH values above 5. Comparing the kefir grain and the kefir, an 
      increase in the population of Gluconobacter in grain sample B was observed. This was 
      also the case for Acetobacter orientalis in sample D. In relation to 26S 
      pyrosequencing, our study revealed the presence of 3 main yeast species: Naumovozyma 
      spp., Kluyveromyces marxianus, and Kazachastania khefir. For Naumovozyma, further 
      studies are needed to assess the isolation of new species. In conclusion, this study 
      has proved that it is possible to establish the patterns of bacterial and yeast 
      composition of kefir and kefir grain. This was only achieved with the use of 
      high-throughput sequencing techniques.

AB  - The therapeutic use of probiotics for supporting the antibiotic action against 
      gastrointestinal disorders is a current trend and emerging applications have gained 
      popularity because of their support for various microbiological activities in 
      digestive processes. Microorganisms isolated from kefir with great probiotic 
      properties, in addition to high resistance to harsh environmental conditions, have 
      been widely researched. Administration of probiotic yeasts offers a number of 
      advantages, when compared to bacteria, because of particular characteristics as 
      their larger cell size. In the present study, 28 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      were isolated, after in vitro digestion of kefir-fermented milk, and identified by 
      molecular based approaches. A screening was performed to determine important quality 
      requirements for probiotics including: antagonistic and antioxidant activities, 
      β-galactosidase synthesis, autoaggregation, surface hydrophobicity and adhesion to 
      epithelial cells. The results showed strains: with antagonistic activity against 
      microbial pathogens such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
      Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis; able to produce β-galactosidase; with 
      antioxidant activity levels higher than 90%; with hydrophobicity activity and 
      autoaggregation ability (evaluated by adhesion test, where all the strains presented 
      adhesion to mice ileal epithelial cells). These findings are relevant and the 
      strains are recommended for further in vivo studies as well as for potential 
      therapeutic applications.

TI  - Molecular identification and typing of lactobacilli isolated from kefir grains.
PG  - 20-7
AB  - Seventeen heterofermentative lactobacilli isolated from kefir grains were 
      characterized by molecular methods. Bacterial isolates were identified by 
      amplification of 16S rRNA gene and analysis by Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction 
      Analysis (ARDRA), using the restriction enzymes Hae III, Dde I, and Hinf I. ARDRA 
      analysis of lactobacilli isolates showed, for each enzyme used, a same banding 
      pattern between the heterofermentative lactobacilli and the reference strains 
      Lactobacillus kefir JCM 5818 and Lb. kefir ATCC 8007. Other reference lactobacilli 
      and one homofermentative isolate showed differences in at least one of these 
      patterns. The 16S-23S rRNA spacer region was also used to discriminate the bacterial 
      isolates at the species level. The data obtained from the analysis of spacer region 
      confirmed that sequencing of this genome region is a good tool for a reliable 
      identification of members of Lb. kefir species. Genotyping of isolates was performed 
      by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD-PCR) analysis using M13, Coc, ERIC-2 and 
      1254 primers. Patterns obtained allowed the differentiation of isolates in three 
      groups. The three clusters showed by RAPD-PCR analysis could be correlated with at 
      least three different strains of Lb. kefir species in the group of 
      heterofermentative lactobacilli isolates obtained from Argentinian kefir grains.

AB  - Milk products are good sources of calcium that may reduce bone resorption and help 
      prevent bone loss as well as promote bone remodeling and increase bone formation. 
      Kefir is a product made by kefir grains that degrade milk proteins into various 
      peptides with health-promoting effects, including antithrombotic, antimicrobial and 
      calcium-absorption enhancing bioactivities. In a controlled, parallel, double-blind 
      intervention study over 6 months, we investigated the effects of kefir-fermented 
      milk (1,600 mg) supplemented with calcium bicarbonate (CaCO3, 1,500 mg) and bone 
      metabolism in 40 osteoporosis patients, and compared them with CaCO3 alone without 
      kefir supplements. Bone turnover markers were measured in fasting blood samples 
      collected before therapy and at 1, 3, and 6 months. Bone mineral density (BMD) 
      values at the spine, total hip, and hip femoral neck were assessed by dual-energy 
      x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and at 6 months. Among patients treated with 
      kefir-fermented milk, the relationships between baseline turnover and 6 months 
      changes in DXA-determined BMD were significantly improved. The serum β C-terminal 
      telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTX) in those with T-scores > -1 patients 
      significantly decreased after three months treatment. The formation marker serum 
      osteocalcin (OC) turned from negative to positive after 6 months, representing the 
      effect of kefir treatment. Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) increased significantly 
      after treatment with kefir, but decreased significantly in the control group. PTH 
      may promote bone remodeling after treatment with kefir for 6 months. In this pilot 
      study, we concluded that kefir-fermented milk therapy was associated with short-term 
      changes in turnover and greater 6-month increases in hip BMD among osteoporotic 
      patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02361372.

TI  - Combination of Whole Grapeseed Flour and Newly Isolated Kefir Lactic Acid Bacteria 
      Reduces High-Fat-Induced Hepatic Steatosis.
PG  - e1801040
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201801040 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: This study aims to determine the separate and combined effect of a prebiotic 
      (catechin-rich wine grapeseed flour, GSF) and a probiotic (newly isolated kefir 
      lactic acid bacteria, LAB) on hepatic steatosis of obese mice. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      High-fat (HF)-induced obese mice are fed a HF diet containing 6% microcrystalline 
      cellulose (MCC, control), 10% GSF, orally administrated LAB, or a combination of GSF 
      and LAB for 9 weeks. There is a significant reduction of body weight gain and liver 
      weights, plasma insulin concentrations, and HOMA-IR in all experimental groups 
      compared to control. Total lipid content, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein 
      (LDL)-cholesterol concentrations of the liver are also significantly lowered. The 
      combination of GSF and LAB further significantly affects cecum propionate content, 
      plasma aspartate aminotransferase (AST/GOT), and zonulin concentrations, which is 
      significantly correlated with hepatic lipid content. Analysis of hepatic microarray 
      data reveals that genes related to lipid synthesis, bile acid and cholesterol 
      synthesis, antioxidant activities, oxidative stress, inflammation, and liver 
      function are significantly modulated following the combination of GSF and LAB. 
      CONCLUSION: These data suggest that amelioration of HF-induced hepatic steatosis 
      after consumption of GSF and LAB is partially mediated via alteration of cecum 
      propionate and intestinal permeability, which modulates hepatic gene expression.

AB  - Mixture of pomegranate juice and whey was evaluated as a potential substrate for 
      production of a novel probiotic beverage by kefir grains. Different fermentation 
      conditions were used as viz: two fermentation temperature (19 ºC and 25 ºC) and two 
      levels of kefir grains inoculum (5 % and 8%w/v). pH, acidity, lactose consumption as 
      well as organic acids formation were determined during 32 hours of fermentation. 
      Results showed that kefir grains were able to utilize lactose and decrease pH, 
      increase acidity, produce lactic acid and acetic acid, while the level of citric 
      acid decreased. It was observed these change depended on temperature and level of 
      kefir grains with the highest changes at the temperature of 25 ºC and kefir grains 
      inoculum of 8%w/v. Pomegranate juice and whey mixture therefore may serve as a 
      suitable substrate for the production of novel probiotic dairy-fruit juice beverage 
      by kefir grains and the sensory characteristics of this beverage were shown 
      desirable results.

AB  - Sourdough breads prepared with kefir grains resulted in appearance of rope spoilage 
      at the 15th day of bread storage, while the control samples (sourdough breads 
      prepared with wild microflora) were spoiled approximately at the 7th day. Denaturing 
      Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis confirmed the above macroscopic 
      observation since Bacillus spp. were detected on sourdough breads prepared with 
      kefir grains at the 15th day of bread storage. The content of organic acids that 
      play synergistic role regarding the enhancement of bread self life was also 
      determined. Lactic acid concentration of sourdough breads prepared with kefir grains 
      were approximately 41-82% higher than the control samples, while acetic acid 
      concentration was about 0.5-1-fold higher respectively. The concentration of some 
      other organic acids studied was also found in higher levels (up to 0.06μg/g) than 
      the control samples. These findings could probably explain the stability of breads 
      prepared with kefir grains against rope spoilage.

AB  - Lacticin 3147 is a two-peptide broad spectrum lantibiotic produced by Lactococcus 
      lactis DPC3147 shown to inhibit a number of clinically relevant Gram-positive 
      pathogens. Initially isolated from an Irish kefir grain, lacticin 3147 is one of the 
      most extensively studied lantibiotics to date. In this study, the bacterial 
      diversity of the Irish kefir grain from which L. lactis DPC3147 was originally 
      isolated was for the first time investigated using a high-throughput parallel 
      sequencing strategy. A total of 17 416 unique V4 variable regions of the 16S rRNA 
      gene were analysed from both the kefir starter grain and its derivative 
      kefir-fermented milk. Firmicutes (which includes the lactic acid bacteria) was the 
      dominant phylum accounting for > 92% of sequences. Within the Firmicutes, dramatic 
      differences in abundance were observed when the starter grain and kefir milk 
      fermentate were compared. The kefir grain-associated bacterial community was largely 
      composed of the Lactobacillaceae family while Streptococcaceae (primarily 
      Lactococcus spp.) was the dominant family within the kefir milk fermentate. 
      Sequencing data confirmed previous findings that the microbiota of kefir milk and 
      the starter grain are quite different while at the same time, establishing that the 
      microbial diversity of the starter grain is not uniform with a greater level of 
      diversity associated with the interior kefir starter grain compared with the 
      exterior.

AB  - The search for new bioactive molecules is a driving force for research 
      pharmaceutical industries, especially those molecules obtained from fermentation. 
      The molecules possessing angiogenic and anti-inflammatory attributes have attracted 
      attention and are the focus of this study. Angiogenic activity from kefir 
      polysaccharide extract, via chorioallantoic membrane assay, exhibited a 
      pro-angiogenic effect compared with vascular endothelial factor (pro-angiogenic) and 
      hydrocortisone (anti-angiogenic) activity as standards with an EC50 of 192ng/mL. In 
      terms of anti-inflammatory activity determined via hyaluronidase enzyme assay, kefir 
      polysaccharide extract inhibited the enzyme with a minimal activity of 2.08mg/mL and 
      a maximum activity of 2.57mg/mL. For pharmaceutical purposes, kefir polysaccharide 
      extract is considered to be safe because it does not inhibit VERO cells in 
      cytotoxicity assays.

TI  - Physicochemical properties of pork loin marinated in kefir, yoghurt or buttermilk 
      and cooked sous vide.
PG  - 163-171
LID - 10.17306/J.AFS.0642 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most important qualities of meat and meat products include 
      tenderness, juiciness and color. Sour meat marinating is a commonly used technique. 
      In the available literature, there are no reports on the use of fermented dairy 
      products (FDP) for meat marinating. The acids contained in FDP can improves the 
      tenderness, taste, flavor, juiciness and color of meat products. The use of lower 
      heat treatment temperature for a long time for cooking meat also positively affects 
      its sensory properties and texture. The aim of the study was to determine the 
      influence of marinating meat in kefir, yoghurt or buttermilk and cooking it sous 
      vide (SV) on its physicochemical properties. METHODS: Muscle cut into slices (m. 
      longissimus dorsi thoracis) was placed in plastic bags, FDP were added to the meat, 
      and the bags were then vacuum-sealed and refrigerated (4&deg;C/48 h). After this 
      time, one of the samples of each variant was analyzed, and the second was cooked SV 
      (63&deg;C/3 h). In the raw and cooked samples, the following were determined: 
      chemical composition, acidity, redox potential, fat oxidation degree and physical 
      parameters, such as texture (TPA test) and color (CIE Lab). RESULTS: Marinating meat 
      did not affect weight loss during meat storage and heat treatment, nor the moisture 
      and protein content. Meat marinating decreased the pH, but had no effect on the 
      content of fat oxidation products and the reduction potential in raw meat. 
      Marinating meat in buttermilk and yogurt and cooking SV resulted in lowering the fat 
      content and limiting oxidation, increasing the reduction potential, reducing 
      hardness and chewiness and increasing the redness of the samples. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Marinating meat, especially in buttermilk or yogurt and cooking SV, improves its 
      texture and color and limits oxidation processes. There was no positive effect of 
      marinating meat in kefir on the parameters tested.

TI  - Whey-cheese production using freeze-dried kefir culture as a starter.
PG  - 1170-83
AB  - AIMS: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of a freeze-dried kefir 
      culture in the production of a novel type of whey-cheese similar to traditional 
      Greek Myzithra-cheese, to achieve improvement of the quality characteristics of the 
      final product and the extension of shelf-life. METHODS AND RESULTS: The use of kefir 
      culture as a starter led to increased lactic acid concentrations and decreased pH 
      values in the final product compared with whey-cheese without starter culture. The 
      effect of the starter culture on production of aroma-related compounds responsible 
      for cheese flavour was also studied using the solid phase microextraction gas 
      chromatography/mass spectrometry technique. Spoilage in unsalted kefir-whey-cheese 
      was observed on the thirteenth and the twentieth day of preservation at 10 and 5 
      degrees C, respectively, while the corresponding times for unsalted whey-cheese 
      preservation were 11 and 14 days. CONCLUSIONS: The cheeses produced were 
      characterized as high-quality products during the preliminary sensory evaluation. An 
      indication of increased preservation time was attributed to the freeze-dried kefir 
      culture, which also seemed to suppress growth of pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT 
      OF THE STUDY: The results suggested the use of kefir culture as a means to extend 
      the shelf-life of dairy products with reduced or no salt content.

TI  - The effects of kefir, koumiss, yogurt and commercial probiotic formulations on PPARα 
      and PPAR-β/δ expressions in mouse kidney.

AB  - Commercial probiotic capsules that contain probiotic bacteria, kefir, koumiss and 
      yogurt contain beneficial microorganisms that affect cholesterol levels and immune 
      response, and are used for treatment of some diseases. We investigated using 
      immunohistochemistry the effects of kefir, koumiss, yogurt and a commercial 
      probiotic formulation on the expression levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated 
      receptor-α (PPARα) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-β/δ (PPAR-β/δ), 
      which are members of the nuclear steroid hormone receptor superfamily in mouse 
      kidney. Mice were assigned to five groups: group 1, commercial probiotic capsules; 
      group 2, kefir; group 3, koumiss; group 4, yogurt; group 5, control. After oral 
      administration for 15 days, body weights were recorded and kidney tissue samples 
      were obtained. Hematoxylin & eosin staining and the streptavidin-biotin peroxidase 
      complex (ABC) method were applied to tissue sections to examine histology and to 
      determine the localization of PPARα and PPAR-β/δ in the kidneys. We found that the 
      weights of the mice in the kefir, koumiss, yogurt and commercial probiotic capsules 
      groups were increased compared to controls. No differences in kidney histology were 
      observed in any of the experimental groups. Kefir, koumiss, yogurt and the 
      commercial probiotic preparation increased PPARα and PPAR-β/δ expressions.

TI  - Heterogeneity of S-layer proteins from aggregating and non-aggregating Lactobacillus 
      kefir strains.
PG  - 363-72
LID - 10.1007/s10482-009-9322-y [doi]
AB  - Since the presence of S-layer protein conditioned the autoaggregation capacity of 
      some strains of Lactobacillus kefir, S-layer proteins from aggregating and 
      non-aggregating L. kefir strains were characterized by immunochemical reactivity, 
      MALDI-TOF spectrometry and glycosylation analysis. Two anti-S-layer monoclonal 
      antibodies (Mab5F8 and Mab1F8) were produced; in an indirect enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay Mab1F8 recognized S-layer proteins from all L. kefir tested 
      while Mab5F8 recognized only S-layer proteins from aggregating strains. Periodic 
      Acid-Schiff staining of proteins after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under 
      denaturing conditions revealed that all L. kefir S-layer proteins tested were 
      glycosylated. Growth of bacteria in the presence of the N-glycosylation inhibitor 
      tunicamycin suggested the presence of glycosydic chains O-linked to the protein 
      backbone. MALDI-TOF peptide map fingerprint for S-layer proteins from 12 L. kefir 
      strains showed very similar patterns for the aggregating strains, different from 
      those for the non-aggregating ones. No positive match with other protein spectra in 
      MSDB Database was found. Our results revealed a high heterogeneity among S-layer 
      proteins from different L. kefir strains but also suggested a correlation between 
      the structure of these S-layer glycoproteins and the aggregation properties of whole 
      bacterial cells.

TI  - In vitro digestibility of goat milk and kefir with a new standardised static 
      digestion method (INFOGEST cost action) and bioactivities of the resultant peptides.
PG  - 2322-30
LID - 10.1039/c5fo00357a [doi]
AB  - The hydrolysis degrees of goat milk and kefir during simulated gastrointestinal 
      digestion and some bioactivities of the resulting peptides after fermentation and 
      digestion were studied. A static in vitro digestion method by the COST FA1005 Action 
      INFOGEST was used and goat milk and kefir were partially hydrolyzed during the 
      gastric phase and had above 80% hydrolysis after duodenal digestion. There were no 
      differences between the digestibility of goat milk and kefir (p > 0.05). Goat milk 
      and kefir displayed about 7-fold antioxidant activity after digestion (p < 0.05). 
      Fermentation showed no effect on the calcium-binding capacity of the samples (p > 
      0.05), however, after in vitro digestion calcium-binding capacity of the goat milk 
      and kefir increased 2 and 5 fold, respectively (p < 0.05). Digested goat milk and 
      kefir showed a higher dose-dependent inhibitory effect on α-amylase compared to 
      undigested samples (p < 0.05). α-Glucosidase inhibitory activities and in vitro bile 
      acid-binding capacities of the samples were not determined at the studied 
      concentrations.

TI  - Supplementation with Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens ZW3 from Tibetan Kefir improves 
      depression-like behavior in stressed mice by modulating the gut microbiota.
PG  - 925-937
LID - 10.1039/c8fo02096e [doi]
AB  - Increasing evidence indicates that probiotics can effectively improve 
      depression-like behavior. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In 
      this study, the antidepressant effect of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens CGMCC2809 
      (ZW3) isolated from Tibetan Kefir grains was investigated using a mouse model of 
      chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). ZW3 improved depression-like behavior and 
      independent exploration ability in the CUMS group. Moreover, ZW3 regulated 
      biochemical disorders in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, immune system and 
      tryptophan metabolism caused by stress. Furthermore, ZW3 could modulate the 
      composition of the gut microbiota, and alleviate constipation by improving the fecal 
      water content in stressed mice. We found that the probiotic strain was present in 
      the whole intestine, even 7 days after its administration was stopped. These results 
      suggest that L. kefiranofaciens ZW3 might improve depression by regulating the gut 
      microbiota as a probiotic food.

AB  - Characterization and stability of lactobacilli and yeasts from kefir grains using 
      culture-dependent and culture-independent methods were investigated in this study. 
      Culture-dependent analysis, followed by sequencing of 16S ribosomal DNA for bacteria 
      and 26S rRNA gene for yeasts, revealed 3 different species of lactobacilli and 
      yeasts, respectively. The most frequently isolated bacterial species were 
      Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens ssp. kefirgranum, Lb. parakefiri, and Lb. kefiri, 
      whereas yeasts belonged to Kluyveromyces marxianus, Kazachstania exigua, and 
      Rhodosporidium kratochvilovae. This study is the first to report on the presence of 
      R. kratochvilovae in kefir grains. On the other hand, PCR-denaturing gradient gel 
      electrophoresis in the culture-independent method showed that the dominant 
      microorganisms were Lb. kefiranofaciens ssp. kefirgranum, Kl. marxianus and Ka. 
      exigua, but did not reveal bands corresponding to Lb. parakefiri, Lb. kefiri, or R. 
      kratochvilovae. Our results support the necessity of combining more techniques for 
      detailed and reliable study of microbial communities in kefir grains. Another 
      interesting finding confirmed that the detected dominant microbiota of kefir grains 
      is very stable and did not change over experimental time. This finding is important 
      to ensure consistent product quality.

TI  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens: From Isolation and Taxonomy to Probiotic Properties 
      and Applications.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms9102158 [doi]
LID - 2158
AB  - One of the main lactic acid bacterial species found in the kefir grain ecosystem 
      worldwide is Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, exhibiting strong auto-aggregation 
      capacity and, therefore, being involved in the mechanism of grain formation. Its 
      occurrence and dominance in kefir grains of various types of milk and geographical 
      origins have been verified by culture-dependent and independent approaches using 
      multiple growth media and regions of the 16S rRNA gene, respectively, highlighting 
      the importance of their combination for its taxonomic identification. L. 
      kefiranofaciens comprises two subspecies, namely kefiranofaciens and kefirgranum, 
      but only the first one is responsible for the production of kefiran, the 
      water-soluble polysaccharide, which is a basic component of the kefir grain and 
      famous for its technological as well as health-promoting properties. L. 
      kefiranofaciens, although very demanding concerning its growth conditions, can be 
      involved in mechanisms affecting intestinal health, immunomodulation, control of 
      blood lipid levels, hypertension, antimicrobial action, and protection against 
      diabetes and tumors. These valuable bio-functional properties place it among the 
      most exquisite candidates for probiotic use as a starter culture in the production 
      of health-beneficial dairy foods, such as the kefir beverage.

      microscopy and aggregation assays. Six out of twenty Lb. kefir strains were able to 
      co-aggregate with Sacch. lipolytica CIDCA 812 and showed thermolabile non-covalently 
      bound surface molecules involved in this interaction. Co-aggregation inhibition 
      after Lb. kefir pre-treatment with 5 m-LiCl or 20 g SDS/l showed that bacterial 
      S-layer proteins play an important role in this interaction. Presence of different 
      sugar (mannose, sucrose and fructose) or yeast pre-treatment with sodium periodate 
      inhibited co-aggregation between Lb. kefir and Sacch. lipolytica. Co-aggregating Lb. 
      kefir strains were also able to agglutinate with human red blood cells and they lost 
      this ability after treatment with 5 m-LiCl. These results and the capacity of 
      purified S-layer proteins of Lb. kefir to haemagglutinate, strongly suggest that a 
      lectin-like activity of bacterial surface proteins (S-layer) mediates the 
      aggregation with yeast cells.

AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum CIDCA 8327 is an exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producer strain 
      isolated from kefir with promising properties for the development of functional 
      foods. The aim of the present study was to characterize the structure of the EPS 
      synthesized by this strain grown in skim milk or semidefined medium (SDM). 
      Additionally, genes involved in EPS synthesis were detected by PCR. L. plantarum 
      produces an EPS with a molecular weight of 10(4)Da in both media. When grown in SDM 
      produce an heteropolysaccharide composed mainly of glucose, glucosamine and rhamnose 
      meanwhile the EPS produced in milk was composed exclusively of glucose indicating 
      the influence of the sugar source. FTIR spectra of this EPS showed signals 
      attributable to an α-glucan. Both by (1)H NMR and methylation analysis it was 
      possible to determine that this polysaccharide is a branched α-(1→4)-d-glucan 
      composed of 80% linear α-(1→4)-d-glucopyranosyl units and 19% (1→4)-d-glucopyranosyl 
      units substituted at O-3 by single α-d-glucopyranosil residues.

TI  - In Vitro Characterization of Lactic Acid Bacteria from Indonesian Kefir Grains as 
      Probiotics with Cholesterol-Lowering Effect.
PG  - 726-732
LID - 10.4014/jmb.1910.10028 [doi]
AB  - Indonesian kefir grains are potential sources of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) that may 
      act as probiotics with specific functional properties. In this study we explored the 
      potential of the probiotic and cholesterol-lowering effect of LAB isolated from 
      Indonesian kefir grains obtained from Bogor, Bandung, Jakarta, and Yogyakarta. The 
      results revealed that 10 isolates showed considerable survivability at low pH and 
      bile salt with total cell reduction of ~3 log colony-forming units per milliliter 
      after exposure to pH 2.5 and 0.5% (w/v) bile salt for 1 and 3 h, respectively. All 
      strains exhibited strong antimicrobial activities against pathogenic bacteria and 
      were sensitive to a wide spectrum of antibiotics but exhibited weak bile salt 
      hydrolase activity. Identification based on 16S RNA suggested that nine isolates 
      were Lactobacillus kefiri and one was Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The ability of the 
      isolates to reduce cholesterol from the media varied, ranging from 22.08% to 68.75% 
      with the highest reduction shown by L. kefiri JK17. The ability to remove 
      cholesterol from the media decreased greatly in resting and dead cells, ranging from 
      14.58% to 22.08% in resting cells and from 7.89% to 18.17% in dead cells. It can be 
      concluded that Indonesian kefir grains contain LAB potentially acting as probiotics 
      capable of reducing cholesterol. The cholesterol-lowering effect especially occurs 
      when the cells are metabolically active.

TI  - Improvement of viability of probiotic bacteria, organoleptic qualities and physical 
      characteristics in kefir using transglutaminase and xanthan.
PG  - 141-148
LID - 10.17306/J.AFS.0556 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Using kefir as a probiotic food carrier has many benefits. At the same 
      time, it is considered an appropriate product for the dairy industry. The aim of 
      this study was to evaluate the effect of xanthan gum and transglutaminase enzyme on 
      the viability of probiotics and the organoleptic qualities and physicochemical 
      characteristics of kefir. METHODS: Three levels of transglutaminase enzyme (50, 100 
      and 150 ppm), and xanthan gum (0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2%) were used. Sensory and 
      physicochemical properties and viability of probiotic bac- teria were measured over 
      2 weeks of storage at 4&deg;C. RESULTS: By increasing the amounts of xanthan gum and 
      transglutaminase, the viscosity of the samples was increased and syneresis was 
      reduced significantly (P < 0.05). The kefir sample containing 150 ppm enzyme and 
      0.2% gum had the highest number of probiotic bacteria. Moreover, the highest 
      organoleptic scores were found for this sample. CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded 
      that adding 150 ppm transglutaminase and 0.2% xanthan improved the vi- ability of 
      probiotics and the physical and organoleptic characteristics of kefir.

TI  - Antimicrobial and healing activity of kefir and kefiran extract.
PG  - 404-8
AB  - Kefir and its insoluble polysaccharide, kefiran, were both tested for antimicrobial 
      and cicatrizing activities against several bacterial species and Candida albicans 
      using an agar diffusion method. Comparator antimicrobials were also tested. 
      Cicatrizing experiments were carried out on Wistar rats with induced skin lesions 
      and Staphylococcus aureus inoculation, using a topical application of a 70% kefir 
      gel. Both kefir and kefiran showed some activity against all organisms tested; the 
      highest activity was against Streptococcus pyogenes. Cicatrizing experiments using 
      70% kefir gel had a protective effect on skin connective tissue and 7 days treatment 
      enhanced wound healing compared with 5 mg/kg of neomycin-clostebol emulsion.

TI  - Microbiological study of lactic acid bacteria in kefir grains by culture-dependent 
      and culture-independent methods.
PG  - 492-501
LID - 10.1016/j.fm.2008.01.003 [doi]
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in different original kefir grains were first assessed 
      using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) 
      by a culture-dependent way, and were further confirmed by DNA sequencing techniques. 
      Results indicated that a combined method of cultivation with PCR-DGGE and subsequent 
      DNA sequencing could successfully identify four LAB strains from three kefir grains 
      from Taiwan (named Hsinchu, Mongolia and Ilan). Lactobacillus kefiri accounted, in 
      the three kefir grains, for at least half of the isolated colonies while Lb. 
      kefiranofaciens was the second most frequently isolated species. Leuconostoc 
      mesenteroides was less frequently found but still in the three kefir grains 
      conversely to Lactococcus lactis which based on culture-dependent isolation was only 
      found in two of the kefir grains. It was interesting to find that all three kefir 
      grains contain similar LAB species. Furthermore, the DGGE as a culture-independent 
      method was also applied to detect the LAB strains. Results indicated that Lb. 
      kefiranofaciens was found in all three kefir grains, whereas Lb. kefiri was only 
      observed in Hsinchu kefir grain and Lc. lactis was found in both Mongolia and Ilan 
      samples. Two additional strains, Pseudomonas spp. and E. coli, were also detected in 
      kefir grains.

TI  - Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in kefir grains and kefir made from them.
PG  - 1-6
AB  - In an investigation of the changes in the microflora along the pathway: kefir grains 
      (A)-->kefir made from kefir grains (B)-->kefir made from kefir as inoculum (C), the 
      following species of lactic acid bacteria (83-90%) of the microbial count in the 
      grains) were identified: Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Streptococcus 
      thermophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus, 
      Lactobacillus casei subsp. pseudoplantarum and Lactobacillus brevis. Yeasts (10-17%) 
      identified were Kluyveromyces marxianus var. lactis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
      Candida inconspicua and Candida maris. In the microbial population of kefir grains 
      and kefir made from them the homofermentative lactic streptococci (52-65% and 
      79-86%, respectively) predominated. Within the group of lactobacilli, the 
      homofermentative thermophilic species L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and L. 
      helveticus (70-87% of the isolated bacilli) predominated. Along the pathway 
      A-->B-->C, the streptococcal proportion in the total kefir microflora increased by 
      26-30% whereas the lactobacilli decreased by 13-23%. K. marxianus var. lactis was 
      permanently present in kefir grains and kefirs, whereas the dominant 
      lactose-negative yeast in the total yeast flora of the kefir grains dramatically 
      decreased in kefir C.

TI  - Whey permeate fermented with kefir grains shows antifungal effect against Fusarium 
      graminearum.
PG  - 249-55
LID - 10.1017/S0022029916000121 [doi]
AB  - The objective of the work reported here was to study the antifungal capability of 
      cell-free supernatants obtained from whey permeates after fermentation by the kefir 
      grains CIDCA AGK1 against Fusarium graminearum growth and zearalenone (ZEA) 
      production. The assays were performed in order to study the conidial germination 
      inhibition -in liquid media- and the effect on fungal growth rate and the Latency 
      phase -in solid media. We observed that fermented supernatants of pH 3·5 produced 
      the highest percentages of inhibition of conidial germination. The dilution and, 
      particularly, alkalinisation of them led to the gradual loss of antifungal activity. 
      In the fungal inhibition assays on plates we found that only the highest proportion 
      of supernatant within solid medium had significant antifungal activity, which was 
      determined as fungicidal. There was no ZEA biosynthesis in the medium with the 
      highest proportion of supernatant, whereas at lower concentrations, the mycotoxin 
      production was strain-dependent. From the results obtained we concluded that kefir 
      supernatants had antifungal activity on the F. graminearum strains investigated and 
      inhibited mycotoxin production as well, but in a strain-dependent fashion. The 
      present work constitutes the first report of the effect of the products obtained 
      from the kefir-grain fermentation of whey permeates - a readily available by-product 
      of the dairy industry - on F. graminearum germination, growth, and toxin production.

AB  - The injuries caused by spray drying (SD) of three potential probiotic lactobacilli 
      isolated from kefir grains and the impact on some probiotic properties, were 
      evaluated. Results demonstrated that Lactobacillus plantarum 83114 and L. kefir 8321 
      showed a slight reduction of viability (0.11 and 0.29 log CFU/ml respectively) after 
      SD process, and L. kefir 8348 was found to be more sensitive to the process with a 
      reduction in viability of 0.70 log CFU/ml. Neither membrane damage, evaluated by 
      increased sensitivity to NaCl, lysozyme, bile salt and penicillin G, nor changes in 
      acidifying activity in MRS and milk by lactobacilli were detected after SD. L. 
      plantarum 83114 and L. kefir 8321 after SD did not lose their capacity to adhere to 
      intestinal cells. Nevertheless, L. kefir 8348 showed a significant loss of adhesion 
      capacity after SD. In addition, rehydrated spray-dried L. kefir 8321 retained the 
      ability to protect against Salmonella invasion of intestinal cells. This effect was 
      observed when L. kefir is co-incubated with Salmonella before invasion assay. This 
      work shows that the membrane integrity evaluated by indirect methods and some 
      probiotic properties of lactobacilli isolated from kefir did not change 
      significantly after SD, and these powders could be used in functional foods 
      applications.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of kefir beverages 
      made from yam, sesame and bean extracts after fermentation of the extracts with 
      water kefir grains. Formulations were prepared with raw and boiled yams. To the yam 
      extract, sesame and different percentages of white bean extract were added. The 
      fermentation kinetics, the chemical composition and color of the extracts were 
      analyzed. To determine the fermentation kinetic parameters, pH and titratable 
      acidity were evaluated. The chemical composition and color of all extracts were 
      determined before and after fermentation process. The decrease in pH and increase in 
      titratable acidity were affected both by raw or boiler yam. The addition of bean 
      extract favored the decrease in pH of formulations containing extracts of raw or 
      boiled yams. Chemical composition and color of the beverages were altered after 
      fermentation. The kefir beverage made from yam and sesame enriched with 50% beans 
      proved to be an excellent fermentation substrate. In addition, it is a new way of 
      consuming vegetable products, especially fermented products, which have limited 
      diversity to serve vegan consumers and also people with certain allergies to dairy 
      products.

AB  - Pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) is well known for its health and nutritional benefits and 
      is recommended for daily consumption. This is the first report on optimization and 
      development of fermented pumpkin-based water kefir beverage. Optimum pumpkin puree 
      and brown sugar concentrations were found at 22.28 and 9.07% w/v, respectively, were 
      made into a pumpkin-based beverage and fermented with water kefir grains for 24 h at 
      32 °C. The optimized fermented pumpkin-based water kefir beverage was found to be 
      non-alcoholic, achieved good overall acceptability and high Lactobacillus, acetic 
      acid bacteria and yeast cell viability of approximately 10(12), 10(9) and 
      10(9) CFU mL(-1), respectively. Overall, the optimized product attained superb 
      technological characteristics and has the potential for industrial exploitation as a 
      refreshing water kefir drink.

      Fermentation.

AB  - Eight water kefir fermentation series differing in buffer capacity and calcium 
      concentration of the water used for fermentation were studied during eight 
      backslopping steps. High buffer capacities resulted in high pH values and high 
      calcium concentrations resulted in low pH values at the end of each backslopping 
      step. When the water buffer capacity and/or calcium concentration were below certain 
      minima, the water kefir grain growth decreased gradually over multiple 
      backsloppings. High water buffer capacities resulted in high concentrations of 
      residual total carbohydrate concentrations and low metabolite concentrations. 
      Further, high water buffer capacities resulted in high ratios of lactic acid 
      bacteria to yeasts, which was reflected in high molar ratios of the concentrations 
      of lactic acid to ethanol and acetic acid to ethanol. The most prevalent 
      microorganisms of the water kefir grain inoculum and grains of all fermentation 
      series at the end of the eighth backslopping step were Lactobacillus hilgardii, 
      Lactobacillus nagelii, Lactobacillus paracasei, Bifidobacterium aquikefiri, 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Dekkera bruxellensis. These microbial communities were 
      influenced by the water buffer capacity and had an impact on the substrate 
      consumption and metabolite production during water kefir fermentation.

TI  - Acquisition of the yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus from unpasteurised milk by a kefir 
      grain enhances kefir quality.
LID - fnw165 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsle/fnw165 [doi]
AB  - Kefir is a fermented milk beverage consumed for nutritional and health tonic 
      benefits in many parts of the world. It is produced by the fermentation of milk with 
      a consortium of bacteria and yeast embedded within a polysaccharide matrix. This 
      consortium is not well defined and can vary substantially between kefir grains. 
      There are little data on the microbial stability of kefir grains, nor on 
      interactions between microbes in the grain and in the milk. To study this, a grain 
      was split, with one half of each stored at -20°C and the other half passaged 
      repeatedly in whole unpasteurised milk. Grains passaged in the unpasteurised milk 
      recovered vigour and acquired the yeast Kluyveromyces marxainus from the milk which 
      was confirmed to be the same strain by molecular typing. Furthermore, these passaged 
      grains produced kefir that was distinguished chemically and organoleptically from 
      the stored grains. Some changes in ultrastructure were also observed by scanning 
      electron microscopy. The study showed that kefir grains can acquire yeast from their 
      environment and the final product can be influenced by these newly acquired yeasts. 
      Kluyveromyces marxianus is considered to be responsible for some of the most 
      important characteristics of kefir so the finding that this yeast is part of the 
      less stable microbiota is significant.

TI  - Production of hard-type cheese using free or immobilized freeze-dried kefir cells as 
      a starter culture.
PG  - 5316-23
LID - 10.1021/jf703585y [doi]
AB  - This study provides a contribution to hard-type cheese starter culture production 
      through the use of a freeze-dried culture in the ripening of hard-type cheeses. The 
      effect of initial cell concentration, ripening temperature, and cell immobilization 
      of kefir on the degree of openness, mold spoilage, microbial associations, 
      physicochemical characteristics, and aroma-related compounds was studied. Use of 
      kefir starter cultures resulted in cheese with an increased shelf life and 
      resistance to spoilage as compared to control cheeses without kefir inoculants. 
      Furthermore, the freeze-dried kefir culture improved aroma, taste, and texture 
      characteristics while increasing the degree of openness in comparison to traditional 
      hard-type cheese products. The kefir culture resulted in an increase in counts of 
      total aerobic bacteria, yeasts and molds, lactococci, and lactobacilli until the 
      15th day of ripening. From then on, only lactobacilli counts increased, reaching 
      levels up to 9.17 log CFU/g in cheeses ripened at 5 degrees C using freeze-dried 
      kefir cells immobilized on casein. SPME-GC/MS analysis revealed major differences in 
      volatile composition, especially with regard to alcohols (up to 75%), carbonyl 
      compounds (up to 75%), and esters (up to 64%) between cheeses made with kefir cells 
      and cheeses made without kefir inoculants.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of broth fermented with kefir grains.
PG  - 316-25
LID - 10.1007/s12010-008-8303-3 [doi]
AB  - Kefir grains originate from the Caucasus region and are used for preparing beverages 
      using sugar solution, milk, and fruit juice. As long as they are formed by a 
      microbial consortium useful in the intestine, the produced drinks can be called 
      probiotics. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity during 
      kefir fermentation in sugar broth. Fermentations with three kinds of carbohydrates 
      (molasses, demerara sugar, and brown sugar) as carbon source were carried out. Brown 
      sugar promoted the greatest antimicrobial activities, producing inhibition halos 
      corresponding to 35, 14, 12, 14, and 14 mm for Candida albicans, Salmonella typhi, 
      Shigella sonnei, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, respectively. 
      Different carbon source concentrations and the time of fermentation influenced the 
      size of the inhibition halos of the pathogenic microorganisms.

TI  - Novel Insights for Metabiotics Production by Using Artisanal Probiotic Cultures.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms9112184 [doi]
LID - 2184
AB  - Wild probiotic consortia of microorganisms (bacteria and yeasts) associated in the 
      artisanal cultures' microbiota (milk kefir grains, water kefir grains and kombucha) 
      are considered valuable promoters for metabiotics (prebiotics, probiotics, 
      postbiotics and paraprobiotics) production. The beneficial effects of the fermented 
      products obtained with the artisanal cultures on human well-being are described by 
      centuries and the interest for them is continuously increasing. The wild origin and 
      microbial diversity of these above-mentioned consortia give them extraordinary 
      protection capacity against microbiological contaminants in unusual physico-chemical 
      conditions and unique fermentative behaviour. This review summarizes the state of 
      the art for the wild artisanal cultures (milk and water kefir grains, respectively, 
      kombucha-SCOBY), their symbiotic functionality, and the ability to ferment 
      unconventional substrates in order to obtain valuable bioactive compounds with in 
      vitro and in vivo beneficial functional properties. Due to the necessity of the 
      bioactives production and their use as metabiotics in the modern consumer's life, 
      artisanal cultures are the perfect sources able to biosynthesize complex functional 
      metabolites (bioactive peptides, antimicrobials, polysaccharides, enzymes, vitamins, 
      cell wall components). Depending on the purposes of the biotechnological 
      fermentation processes, artisanal cultures can be used as starters on different 
      substrates. Current studies show that the microbial synergy between bacteria-yeast 
      and/or bacteria-offers new perspectives to develop functional products (food, feeds, 
      and ingredients) with a great impact on life quality.

TI  - Draft genome sequence of Lactobacillus plantarum C4 (CECT 9567), a potential 
      probiotic strain isolated from kefir.
PG  - 409-414
LID - 10.1007/s00203-019-01629-9 [doi]
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum C4 (CECT 9567) was isolated from kefir and has been 
      extensively studied because of its probiotic properties. Here we report the genome 
      sequence of this strain. The genome consists of 3,221,350 bp, and contains 3058 CDSs 
      with an average G + C content of 44.5%. The genome harbors genes encoding the 
      AraC-family transcription regulator, the penicillin-binding protein Pbp2A, and the 
      Na+/H+ antiporter NapA3, which have important roles in the survival of lactobacilli 
      in the gastrointestinal tract. Also, the genome encodes the catalase KatE, NADH 
      peroxidase and glutathione peroxidase, which enable anaerobic respiration, and a 
      nitrate reductase complex, which enable anaerobic respiration. Additionally, genes 
      encoding plantaricins and sactipeptides, and genes involved in the use of 
      fructooligosaccharides and in the production of butyric acid were also identified. 
      BLASTn analysis revealed that 91.4% of CDSs in C4 genome aligned with those of the 
      reference strain L. plantarum WCFS1, with a mean identity of 98.96%. The genome 
      information of L. plantarum C4 provides the basis for understanding the probiotic 
      properties of C4 and to consider its use as a potential component of functional 
      foods.

TI  - Microencapsulation of Bioactive Ingredients for Their Delivery into Fermented Milk 
      Products: A Review.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26154601 [doi]
LID - 4601
AB  - The popularity and consumption of fermented milk products are growing. On the other 
      hand, consumers are interested in health-promoting and functional foods. Fermented 
      milk products are an excellent matrix for the incorporation of bioactive 
      ingredients, making them functional foods. To overcome the instability or low 
      solubility of many bioactive ingredients under various environmental conditions, the 
      encapsulation approach was developed. This review analyzes the fortification of 
      three fermented milk products, i.e., yogurt, cheese, and kefir with bioactive 
      ingredients. The encapsulation methods and techniques alongside the encapsulant 
      materials for carotenoids, phenolic compounds, omega-3, probiotics, and other 
      micronutrients are discussed. The effect of encapsulation on the properties of 
      bioactive ingredients themselves and on textural and sensory properties of fermented 
      milk products is also presented.

AB  - Dairy products are the main source of calcium (Ca), but the loss of the consumption 
      habit contributes to low consumption in adulthood, which leads to osteoporosis and 
      increased fracture risk. Domestic use of kefir is straightforward and the eggshell 
      is a natural discarded source of Ca. This paper proposes the development of an 
      enriched Ca reduced lactose milk using eggshell and kefir. During the in vitro 
      preparation, the pH, Ca and lactose contents were measured. Ca intestinal absorption 
      of untreated milk and milk with kefir was compared. Finally, human volunteers 
      consumed this dairy product and 24-h urine Ca was measured. Results showed that the 
      beverage has lower lactose and higher Ca than untreated milk and milk with kefir. 
      Intestinal Ca absorption was not different between both milks and an increase in 
      urinary Ca excretion was observed in humans. This study provides a methodology to 
      prepare at home a dairy product that could contribute to improve the Ca intake in 
      adults.

TI  - Changes in soymilk during fermentation with kefir culture: oligosaccharides 
      hydrolysis and isoflavone aglycone production.
PG  - 845-50
LID - 10.3109/09637486.2015.1095861 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in oligosaccharides and 
      isoflavone aglycone content in soymilk during fermentation with commercial kefir 
      culture. Soymilk was fermented with kefir culture at 25 °C for 30 h. The counts of 
      lactic acid bacteria, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc sp and yeasts; measurements of 
      pH, acidity, α-galactosidase and β-glucosidase activity, sugar and isoflavone 
      contents were performed at the intervals of time. In the fermented soymilk, the 
      lactic acid bacteria counts increased from 7.6 log to 9.1 CFU g(-1), pH reached to 
      4.9 and lactic acid reached 0.34 g 100  g(- 1). The α-galactosidase was produced 
      (0.016 AU g(-1)) with 100% raffinose and 92% stachyose hydrolysis being observed 
      after the depletion of galactose, glucose and sucrose. Kefir culture produced 
      β-glucosidase (0.0164 AU g(-1)), resulting in 100% bioconversion of glycitin and 
      daidzin and 89% bioconversion of genistin into the corresponding aglycones. The 
      fermented soymilk presented 1.67 μmol g(-1) of daidzein, 0.28 μmol g(-1) of 
      glicitein and 1.67 μmol g (-1) of genistein.

TI  - Probiotic Properties and Cellular Antioxidant Activity of Lactobacillus plantarum 
      MA2 Isolated from Tibetan Kefir Grains.
PG  - 523-533
LID - 10.1007/s12602-017-9349-8 [doi]
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum MA2 was isolated from traditional Chinese Tibetan kefir 
      grains. Its antioxidant properties had been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo 
      previously. In the present study, the probiotic characteristics of this strain were 
      further evaluated by investigating its acid and bile salt tolerances, cell surface 
      hydrophobicity, and autoaggregation, respectively. In addition, the cellular 
      antioxidant activity (CAA) assay was applied to test the antioxidant capacity of the 
      isolate in different growth phases. Same method was also used to evaluate the 
      antioxidant capacity of its fermentation supernatant, cell-free extract, and intact 
      cell quantitatively. The results of probiotic characteristic tests showed that MA2 
      could survive at pH 2.5 and 0.3% bile salt. Meanwhile, the measurements of cell 
      surface hydrophobicity and autoaggregation were 45.29 ± 2.15 and 6.30 ± 0.34%, 
      respectively. The results of cellular antioxidant activity tests indicated that MA2 
      had high antioxidant potential. The CAA value of logarithmic phase cell-free extract 
      of MA2 (39,450.00 ± 424.05 μmol quercetin equivalents/100 g sample) was 
      significantly higher than that in stationary phase cell-free extract 
      (3395.98 ± 126.06 μmol quercetin equivalents/100 g sample) and that of fermentation 
      supernatant in logarithmic phase (2174.41 ± 224.47 μmol quercetin equivalents/100 g 
      sample) (p < 0.05). The CAA method was successively applied to evaluate the 
      antioxidant capacity of MA2 in this study, which suggests that it could be used as a 
      useful method for lactic acid bacteria antioxidant potential evaluation.

      Released during Simulated Gastrointestinal Digestion of Commercial Kefir.
PG  - 1865-1873
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.6b05385 [doi]
AB  - Health-promoting effects of kefir may be partially caused by bioactive peptides. To 
      evaluate their formation or degradation during gastrointestinal digestion, we 
      monitored changes of the peptide profile in a model of (1) oral, (2) gastric, and 
      (3) small intestinal digestion of kefir. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization 
      time-of-flight mass spectroscopy analyses revealed clearly different profiles 
      between digests 2/3 and kefir/digest 1. Subsequent ultraperformance liquid 
      chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry identified 92 
      peptides in total (25, 25, 43, and 30, partly overlapping in kefir and digests 1, 2, 
      and 3, respectively), including 16 peptides with ascribed bioactivity. Relative 
      quantification in scheduled multiple reaction monitoring mode showed that many 
      bioactive peptides were released by simulated digestion. Most prominently, the 
      concentration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor β-casein(203-209) increased 
      approximately 10 000-fold after combined oral, gastric, and intestinal digestion. 
      Thus, physiological digestive processes may promote bioactive peptide formation from 
      proteins and oligopeptides in kefir. Furthermore, bioactive peptides present in 
      certain compartments of the gastrointestinal tract may exert local physiological 
      effects.

TI  - Effect of oral administration of kefir on serum proinflammatory cytokines on 5-FU 
      induced oral mucositis in patients with colorectal cancer.

AB  - In order to investigate the effect of kefir consumption on mucositis induced by 5-FU 
      based chemotherapy (CT), we monitored the systemic immune response by measurement of 
      the serum proinflammatory cytokine levels and we evaluated the anti-microbial effect 
      of kefir with an agar diffusion method. Forty patients with colorectal cancer were 
      included in this randomized prospective study. On the first 5 days of each CT cycle, 
      the study group received oral lavage with kefir and then swallowed 250 ml of kefir 
      while control group received oral lavage with 0.09% NaCl twice a day. Before and 
      after every cycle of CT, the oral mucosa was assessed. Serum proinflammatory 
      cytokine levels were evaluated before the initiation and after the third and the 
      sixth cycle. Kefir was administered in 99 out of 205 courses. Mucositis developed in 
      27.3% of the courses given with kefir administration and in 21.7% of the courses 
      given with 0.9% NaCl oral rinses. The difference between the two groups was not 
      statistically significant (p > 0.05). When we compared the serum proinflammatory 
      cytokine levels of the two groups at the baseline and following the third and the 
      sixth cycles, we again found no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05). 
      Kefir consumption at the mentioned doses made no statistically significant effect on

AB  - In this study, various yeasts (Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces turicensis, 
      Pichia fermentans) and lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, 
      Lactobacillus kefiri, Leuconostoc mesenteroides) were entrapped in 2 different 
      microspheres using an entrapment ratio for the strains that was based on the 
      distribution ratio of these organisms in kefir grains. The purpose of this study was 
      to develop a new technique to produce kefir using immobilized starter cultures 
      isolated from kefir grains. An increase in cell counts with fermentation cycles was 
      observed for both the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts, whereas the cell counts 
      of kefir grains were very stable during cultivation. Scanning electron microscopy 
      showed that the short-chain lactobacilli and lactococci occupied the surface of the 
      LAB microspheres, whereas the long-chain lactobacilli were inside the microspheres. 
      When the yeasts were analyzed, cells at a high density were entrapped in cracks on 
      the surface and within the microspheres, where they were surrounded by the 
      short-chain lactobacilli. The distribution of the LAB and yeast species in kefir 
      produced from grains and microspheres showed that there was no significant 
      difference between the kefirs produced by the 2 methods; moreover, Leu. 
      mesenteroides and K. marxianus were the predominating microflora in both types of 
      kefir. There was no significant difference in the ethanol and exopolysaccharide 
      contents between the 2 kefirs, although the acidity was different.

AB  - Brewer's Spent Grains (BSG) and Malt Spent Rootlets (MSR) were used as supports for 
      kefir cells immobilization and the role of lactose uptake rate by kefir in the 
      positive activity of produced biocatalysts during whey fermentation was 
      investigated. Lactose uptake rate by the immobilized cells was recorded using 
      (14)C-labelled lactose and the effect of various conditions (pH, temperature and 
      kind of support) on it and consequently on fermentation time and ethanol production 
      was examined. The results showed that lactose uptake rate was correlated to 
      fermentation rate and increased as temperature was increased up to 30°C at pH 5.5. 
      The same results have been recently noticed by using biocatalysts with Delignified 
      Cellulosic Materials (DCM) and Gluten Pellets (GP), but fermentation time of about 
      7h by kefir immobilized on DCM and BSG resulted to two fold lower than that on GP 
      and MSR. The highest alcohol concentration was observed by MSR.

AB  - A strategy to reduce the deleterious effects of mycotoxins is to use dietary 
      supplements that contain microorganisms that bind mycotoxins and decrease their 
      gastrointestinal absorption. Novel strains were isolated from a Kefir culture and 
      assessed for their mycotoxin adsorption and biotransformation ability. The most 
      active strains were identified using DNA sequencing, and the stability of 
      microorganism/mycotoxin complexes was evaluated using buffer solutions to simulate 
      the pH conditions in the gastrointestinal tract. Our results showed that the 
      microorganism consortium of Kefir grains adsorbed 82 to 100% of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), 
      zearalenone (ZEA) and ochratoxin A (OTA) when cultivated in milk. The main strains 
      that were capable of mycotoxin adsorption were identified as Lactobacillus kefiri, 
      Kazachstania servazzii and Acetobacter syzygii. The strain L. kefiri KFLM3 was the 
      most active, adsorbing 80 to 100% of the studied mycotoxins when cultivated in milk. 
      Nonetheless, the strain K. servazzii KFGY7 retained more mycotoxin after the 
      desorption experiments (65, 69 and 67% for AFB1, OTA and ZEA, respectively). These 
      findings suggest that Kefir consumption may help to reduce gastrointestinal 
      absorption of these mycotoxins and consequently reduce their toxic effects. The 
      isolated strains may be of interest for the development of fermented dairy products 
      for human consumption that have a new probiotic characteristic, the adsorption of 
      mycotoxins.

TI  - Finding Functional Differences Between Species in a Microbial Community: Case 
      Studies in Wine Fermentation and Kefir Culture.
PG  - 1347

AB  - Microbial life usually takes place in a community where individuals interact, by 
      competition for nutrients, cross-feeding, inhibition by end-products, but also by 
      their spatial distribution. Lactic acid bacteria are prominent members of microbial 
      communities responsible for food fermentations. Their niche in a community depends 
      on their own properties as well as those of the other species. Here, we apply a 
      computational approach, which uses only genomic and metagenomic information and 
      functional annotation of genes, to find properties that distinguish a species from 
      others in the community, as well as to follow individual species in a community. We 
      analyzed isolated and sequenced strains from a kefir community, and metagenomes from 
      wine fermentations. We demonstrate how the distinguishing properties of an organism 
      lead to experimentally testable hypotheses concerning the niche and the interactions 
      with other species. We observe, for example, that L. kefiranofaciens, a dominant 
      organism in kefir, stands out among the Lactobacilli because it potentially has more 
      amino acid auxotrophies. Using metagenomic analysis of industrial wine fermentations 
      we investigate the role of an inoculated L. plantarum in malolactic fermentation. We 
      observed that L. plantarum thrives better on white than on red wine fermentations 
      and has the largest number of phosphotransferase system among the bacteria observed 
      in the wine communities. Also, L. plantarum together with Pantoea, Erwinia, Asaia, 
      Gluconobacter, and Komagataeibacter genera had the highest number of genes involved 
      in biosynthesis of amino acids.

TI  - Effect of Safflower Oil on Concentration of Conjugated Linoleic Acid of Kefir 
      Prepared by Low-fat Milk.
PG  - 128-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a special fatty acid in dairy products 
      with unique antioxidant and anti-cancerous effects. Kefir, a milk product, comprises 
      normalized homogenized cow's milk, the fructose and lactulose syrup as well as a 
      symbiotic starter which has improved probiotic characteristics. The study was aimed 
      to discuss patents and to examine the effect of different safflower oil 
      concentrations on CLA content of the kefir drink prepared by low-fat milk. MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: Safflower oil was added at 0.1, 0.3 and 0.5% (V/V) to low-fat cow's 
      milk and six formulations of kefir samples were prepared. The CLA content of the 
      kefir products was measured at pH=6.0 and pH=6.8 by gas chromatography. Acid and 
      bile tolerance of bacterial microenvironment in the products were also determined. 
      RESULTS: Substitution of natural fat content of milk with safflower oil resulted in 
      proportional increase in the CLA contents of kefir in a dose dependent manner. The 
      highest concentration of CLA was found under 0.5% (V/V) of safflower oil at pH 6.0 
      and temperature of 37 °C. Adding the Safflower oil into milk used for kefir 
      production, increased CLA content from 0.123 (g/100 g) in pure safflower free 
      samples to 0.322 (g/100 g) in samples with 0.5% (V/V) of safflower oil. CONCLUSION: 
      The current study revealed that substitution of safflower oil with natural fat of 
      cow's milk may help the production of kefir samples with remarkable increase in CLA 
      content of final product.

TI  - Identification and comparison of two closely related dextransucrases released by 
      water kefir borne Lactobacillus hordei TMW 1.1822 and Lactobacillus nagelii TMW 
      1.1827.

AB  - Dextransucrases are extracellular enzymes, which are exclusively expressed by lactic 
      acid bacteria (LAB) and produce α-1→6 linked glucose polymers from sucrose. In this 
      study, two dextransucrases derived from water kefir borne Lactobacillus hordei TMW 
      1.1822 and Lactobacillus nagelii TMW 1.1827 were identified and comparatively 
      investigated. Differences between both proteins mainly arise from an additional 
      C-terminal glucan-binding domain and the presence of a signal motif in the L. 
      nagelii TMW 1.1827 dextransucrase. L. hordei TMW 1.1822 released the enzyme only in 
      the presence of its substrate sucrose in contrast to L. nagelii TMW 1.1827, while 
      both strains functionally expressed the dextransucrases independently of sucrose. 
      Both enzymes could be recovered as crude protein extracts in culture supernatants, 
      as they are not covalently bound to the cell surface. This enabled the formation of 
      dextrans at equal reaction conditions as well as their subsequent structural 
      analysis in terms of molecular structure and molecular weight. The volumetric 
      transglycosylation and hydrolysis activities were distinctly different for both 
      enzymes, which produced O3-branched dextrans with a comparable degree of branching. 
      Moreover, identical oligosaccharides were obtained for both dextrans upon 
      endo-dextranase digestion, while some differences in the polysaccharide fine 
      structures could be identified from the varying portions of certain 
      oligosaccharides. Dextrans synthesized by the dextransucrase released by L. nagelii 
      exhibited an averaged molecular weight (M (w)) of 7.9×10(7) Da, while those produced 
      by the dextransucrase released by L. hordei exhibited an M (w) of 6.1×10(7) Da. 
      Moreover, glycosylation of glucansucrases by LAB was identified for the first time 
      for the released dextransucrase of L. nagelii TMW 1.1827. Our study therefore 
      reveals new molecular insights into how dextransucrases released by water kefir 
      borne L. hordei TMW 1.1822 and L. nagelii TMW 1.1827 contribute to the complex 
      formation of the traditional beverage water kefir.

TI  - Bacterial Populations in International Artisanal Kefirs.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8091318 [doi]
LID - 1318
AB  - Artisanal kefir is a traditional fermented dairy product made using kefir grains. 
      Kefir has documented natural antimicrobial activity and health benefits. A typical 
      kefir microbial community includes lactic acid bacteria (LAB), acetic acid bacteria, 
      and yeast among other species in a symbiotic matrix. In the presented work, the 16S 
      rRNA gene sequencing was used to reveal bacterial populations and elucidate the 
      diversity and abundance of LAB species in international artisanal kefirs from Fusion 
      Tea, Britain, the Caucuses region, Ireland, Lithuania, and South Korea. Bacterial 
      species found in high abundance in most artisanal kefirs included Lactobacillus 
      kefiranofaciens, Lentilactobacillus kefiri,Lactobacillus ultunensis, Lactobacillus 
      apis, Lactobacillus gigeriorum, Gluconobacter morbifer, Acetobacter orleanensis, 
      Acetobacter pasteurianus, Acidocella aluminiidurans, and Lactobacillus helveticus. 
      Some of these bacterial species are LAB that have been reported for their 
      bacteriocin production capabilities and/or health promoting properties.

AB  - Fermented dairy products and their component bacteria have been shown to possess 
      health-promoting functions in consumers and recently have been suggested to reduce 
      the risk of colorectal cancer. Kefir and ayran are two popular fermented milk drinks 
      that have their origins in the Caucasus region of Russia. The present study aimed to 
      evaluate their potential anticancer properties in colon cells in vitro. The comet 
      assay and transepithelial resistance assay were used to assess the effect of kefir 
      and ayran supernatants on genotoxicity of fecal water samples and on intestinal 
      tight junction integrity. Their antioxidant capacity was measured by trolox 
      equivalent antioxidant capacity assay and compared with that of unfermented milk. 
      The results showed that DNA damage induced by 2 of 4 fecal water samples was 
      significantly decreased by kefir and ayran supernatants and with ayran the effect 
      was dose-dependent. However no effect on intestinal tight junctions was observed. 
      The supernatants of kefir and ayran contained high amounts of acetic and lactic acid 
      but only a very small quantity of caproic and butyric acid, and they showed 
      significantly greater antioxidant capacity than milk. These findings suggest kefir 
      and ayran can reduce DNA damage, which might be due to their antioxidant capacities.

TI  - Effects of a kefir supplement on symptoms, colonic transit, and bowel satisfaction 
      score in patients with chronic constipation: a pilot study.
PG  - 650-6
LID - 10.5152/tjg.2014.6990 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Although probiotics have been extensively studied in irritable 
      bowel syndrome, data on the impact of probiotics on chronic constipation are scarce. 
      We aimed to evaluate the effects of kefir, which is a probiotic fermented milk 
      product, on the symptoms, colonic transit, and bowel satisfaction scores of patients 
      with chronic constipation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients with 
      functional constipation according to the Rome II criteria were divided into two 
      groups based on their colon transit studies: 1. The normal transit (NT) group 
      (n=10); and 2. The slow transit (ST) group (n=10). After a baseline period, 500 
      mL/day of a probiotic kefir beverage was administered to all patients for 4 weeks. 
      Defecation parameters (stool frequency, stool consistency, degree of straining, 
      laxative consumption) were recorded in diaries daily by the patients. Bowel 
      satisfaction scores were assessed using a visual analog scale. The colon transit 
      study was repeated in the ST group at the end of the study. RESULTS: At the end of 
      the study, the patients showed an increased stool frequency (p<0.001), improved 
      stool consistency (p=0.014), and decreased laxative consumption (p=0.031). The 
      degree of straining during evacuation showed a tendency to improve after kefir 
      administration; however, this was not statistically significant (p=0.18). A repeat 
      transit study showed an acceleration of colonic transit in the ST group (p=0.013). 
      Bowel satisfaction scores also improved (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: This pilot study 
      shows that kefir has positive effects on the symptoms of constipation. Our results 
      also suggest that kefir improves bowel satisfaction scores and accelerates colonic 
      transit. Controlled trials are warranted to confirm these findings.

AB  - AIM: Corrosive esophageal burns are still an important problem. The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the effect of kefir in an experimental corrosive esophagitis 
      model. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Twenty-four male wistar albino rats were used in this 
      experimental study. The rats were randomized into three groups according to the 
      procedure and treatment type (each group has eight rats). Group I: (Control group), 
      Group II: (Induction of corrosive esophagitis with 5 % NaOH without any treatment) 
      and Group III: (Corrosive esophagitis treated with kefir). The rats were sacrificed 
      on the first and seventh days. Mediastinum and abdominal cavity of rats were 
      explorated. Approximately 1.5 cm of esophagus was removed for histopathological 
      examination. Inflammation, injury in the muscularis mucosa and collagen deposition 
      were evaluated. RESULTS: Histopathological results on the first day after caustic 
      injury; inflammation was detected in three rats in Group II and there were no 
      inflammation in rats in Group III. This difference was statistically significant 
      (p<0.05). Injury in muscularis mucosa was detected in three rats in Group II and in 
      one rat in Group III. Histopathological results on the seventh days after caustic 
      injury; Inflammation was positive in four rats in Group II and three rats in Group 
      III. Injury in muscularis mucosa was equal in two groups (three rats each). Collagen 
      deposition with high grade (Grade 2) was detected in two rats in Group II and in 
      four rats in Group III (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Kefir has anti-inflammatory effect 
      specially in early phase of caustic injury. It has also some beneficial effect in 
      wound healing.

      sugary kefir grains.

LID - 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2012.04.014 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, we have investigated the importance of fermentation media on 
      grain formation and the microbial characteristics of sugary kefir. The sugary kefir 
      grains were fermented in brown sugar, cow's milk or goat's milk. Using 
      culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, we identified the microorganisms 
      present in both the grains and filtrate and then evaluated their distribution. The 
      structure of the grains was also observed by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). 
      The identification results indicated that there were remarkable changes in microbial 
      ecological profiles of the sugary kefir grains and their filtrates when brown sugar 
      and milk were compared as fermentation media. Three lactic acid bacteria (LAB) 
      species (Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus mali and Lactobacillus hordei) 
      were found in the grains fermented using brown sugar. However, four species, named 
      Leu. mesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis, Bifidobacterium psychraerophilum and 
      Enterococcus faecalis, were identified in the grains fermented using either cow's or 
      goat's milk. The size and structure of the kefir grains were also significantly 
      influenced by the culture medium. We hypothesize that the grains originally may 
      contain many different microorganisms and the identified changes are an adaption to 
      each specific medium during grain formation and growth. The distribution of strains 
      thus may vary depending on the carbon and energy sources available for grain 
      fermentation and these microbial changes will further affect the granulation and 
      growth of the grains. This study is important to our understanding of the mechanism 
      of kefir grain formation and growth because it explores the relationship between 
      fermentation media and kefir microorganisms.

AB  - Lentilactobacillus kefiri is one of the main lactic acid bacteria species in kefir 
      and it was also isolated from other fermented foods. Numerous strains have been 
      isolated and characterized regarding its potential as probiotics for the development 
      of novel functional foods. To our knowledge this is the first review focused on 
      highlighting safety aspects and health beneficial effects reported for L. kefiri 
      strains. Several L. kefiri strains lack of transmissible antibiotic resistance 
      genes, are tolerant to the harsh conditions of the gastrointestinal environment, and 
      could resist different preservation procedures. Moreover, many of the isolated 
      strains have shown antimicrobial activity against pathogens and their toxins, 
      exhibited immunomodulatory activity as well as induced some beneficial effects at 
      metabolic level. Regarding all the scientific evidence, certain L. kefiri strains 
      emerge as excellent candidates to be applied to the development of both food 
      supplements and new fermented foods with health-promoting properties. However, the 
      availability of genomic information is still very limited, so much more work must be 
      done in order to explore the potentiality of L. kefiri as a probiotic and a source 
      of bioactive metabolites.

TI  - The Genomic Basis of Lactobacilli as Health-Promoting Organisms.
LID - 10.1128/microbiolspec.BAD-0011-2016 [doi]
AB  - Lactobacilli occupy a unique position in human culture and scientific history. Like 
      brewer's and baker's yeast, lactobacilli have been associated with food production 
      and preservation for thousands of years. Lactobacillus species are used in mixed 
      microbial cultures, such as the classical Lactobacillus bulgaricus/Streptococcus 
      thermophilus inoculum for yogurt fermentation, or combinations of diverse 
      lactobacilli/yeasts in kefir grains. The association of lactobacilli consumption 
      with greater longevity and improved health formed the basis for developing 
      lactobacilli as probiotics, whose market has exploded worldwide in the past 10 
      years. The decade that followed the determination of the first genome sequence of a 
      food-associated species, Lactobacillus plantarum, saw the application to 
      lactobacilli of a full range of functional genomics methods to identify the genes 
      and gene products that govern their distinctive phenotypes and health associations. 
      In this review, we will briefly remind the reader of the range of beneficial effects 
      attributed to lactobacilli, and then explain the phylogenomic basis for the 
      distribution of these traits across the genus. Recognizing the strain specificity of 
      probiotic effects, we review studies of intraspecific genomic variation and their 
      contributions to identifying probiotic traits. Finally we offer a perspective on 
      classification of lactobacilli into new genera in a scheme that will make 
      attributing probiotic properties to clades, taxa, and species more logical and more 
      robust.

TI  - Chemical and microbiological characterisation of kefir grains.
PG  - 639-52
AB  - Chemical and microbiological composition of four Argentinean kefir grains from 
      different sources as well as characteristics of the corresponding fermented milk 
      were studied. Kefir grains CIDCA AGK1, AGK2 and AGK4 did not show significant 
      differences in their chemical and microbiological composition. In contrast, protein 
      and yeast content of AGK3 was higher than in the other grains. Although grain 
      microflora comprised lactobacilli, lactococcus, acetic acid bacteria and yeast, we 
      found an important difference regarding species. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 
      Lactobacillus kefir, Lactobacillus plantarum, Acetobacter and Saccharomyces were 
      present in all types of kefir grain. While Leuconostoc mesenteroides was only 
      isolated from grains CIDCA AGK1 and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar 
      diacetylactis, Lactobacillus parakefir and Kluyveromyces marxianus were only 
      isolated from CIDCA AGK2 grains. All grains produced acid products with pH between 
      3.5 and 4.0. The apparent viscosity of AGK1 fermented milk was greater than the 
      product obtained with AGK4. All fermented milks had inhibitory power towards 
      Escherichia coli but AGK1 and AGK2 supernatants were able to halt the bacterial 
      growth for at least 25 h. Grain weight increment in AGK1, AGK2 and AGK3 during 
      growth in milk did not show significant differences. Despite their fermenting 
      activity, AGK4 grains did not increase their weight.

TI  - Amino acid profiles of lactic acid bacteria, isolated from kefir grains and kefir 
      starter made from them.
PG  - 112-23
AB  - The characteristics of cell growth, lactic acid production, amino acid release and 
      consumption by single-strain cultures of lactic acid bacteria (isolated from kefir 
      grains), and by a multiple-strain kefir starter prepared from them, were studied. 
      The change in the levels of free amino acids was followed throughout the kefir 
      process: single-strain kefir bacteria and the kefir starter (Lactococcus lactis 
      C15-1%+Lactobacillus helveticus MP12-3%+(Streptococcus thermophilus 
      T15+Lactobacillus bulgaricus HP1 = 1:1)-3%) were cultivated in pasteurized (92 
      degrees C for 20 min) cow's milk (3% fat content) at 28 degrees C for 5 h (the kefir 
      starter reached pH 4.7) and subsequently grown at 20 degrees C for 16 h; storage was 
      at 4 degrees C for 168 h. The strain L. helveticus MP12 was unrivaled with respect 
      to free amino acid production (53.38 mg (100 g)(-1)) and cell growth (17.8 x 10(8) 
      CFU ml(-1)); however, it manifested the lowest acidification activity. L. bulgaricus 
      HP1 released approximately 3.7 times less amino acids, nearly 5 times lower cell 
      growth, and produced about 1.2 times more lactic acid. S. thermophilus T15 
      demonstrated dramatically complex amino acid necessities for growth and metabolism. 
      With L. lactis C15, the highest levels of growth and lactic acid synthesis were 
      recorded (18.3 x 10(8) CFU ml(-1) and 7.8 g l(-1) lactic acid at the 21st hour), and 
      as for free amino acid production, it approximated L. bulgaricus HP1 (17.03 mg (100 
      g)(-1) maximum concentration). In the L. lactis C15 culture, the amino acids were 
      used more actively throughout the first exponential growth phase (by the 10th hour) 
      than during the second growth phase. The unique properties of the L. helveticus MP12 
      strain to produce amino acids were employed to create a symbiotic bioconsortium 
      kefir culture, which, under conditions of kefir formation, enhanced lactic acid 
      production and shortened the time required to reach pH 4.7; intensified cell growth 
      activity, resulting in a respective 90- and 60-fold increase in the concentration of 
      lactobacilli and cocci in the mixed culture compared to individual cultures; and 
      accumulated free amino acids in the final kefir with higher total concentrations 
      (56.88 mg (100 g)(-1)) and an individual concentration of essential amino acids (1.5 
      times) greater than that of yogurt.

AB  - We investigated using immunohistochemistry the effects of kefir, koumiss and 
      commercial probiotic capsules on the expression of platelet derived growth factor-c 
      (PDGF-C) and platelet derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR-α) in mouse liver 
      and kidney. Mice were assigned to four groups: group 1 was given commercial 
      probiotic capsules, group 2 was given kefir, group 3 was given koumiss and group 4 
      was untreated. After oral administration for 15 days, body weights were recorded and 
      liver and kidney tissue samples were obtained. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was 
      used to examine histology. PDGF-C and PDGFR-α in liver and kidney were localized 
      using the streptavidin-biotin peroxidase complex method (ABC). We found that the 
      weights of the mice in the kefir, koumiss and commercial probiotic capsules groups 
      increased compared to the control group. No differences in liver and kidney 
      histology were observed in any of the experimental groups. Kefir, koumiss and the 
      commercial probiotic preparation increased PDGF-C and PDGFR-α expression.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the isoflavone and total phenolic contents in 
      kefir-fermented soymilk storage and after the in vitro digestive system simulation 
      (DSS). Soymilk was fermented with kefir culture (0.02UC/L) at 25°C for 15h and 
      stored at 4°C for 4days. After the fermentation and storage, the isoflavone and 
      total phenolic contents were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography 
      and spectrophotometry, respectively. The cell viability of lactic acid bacteria and 
      yeast was evaluated. Fermentation promoted an increase of approximately 3log CFU/g 
      cycles of the microorganisms and the storage process did not alter the aglycone 
      isoflavones and total phenolic contents. The content of aglycone isoflavones 
      increased 2-fold, and the total phenolic content increased 9-fold. Therefore, 
      kefir-fermented soymilk is a good source of aglycone isoflavones and phenolics, 
      since the content of these substances was increased significantly after the in vitro 
      digestive system simulation of the product.

AB  - Survival of two Lactobacillus kefir strains after spray drying in reconstituted skim 
      milk with or without the addition of 12.5 g monosodium glutamate/l, 20 g sucrose/l, 
      or 20 g fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS)/l and during subsequent storage under 
      different conditions of temperature (20 and 30°C) and relative humidity (RH) (0, 11 
      and 23%) was evaluated. After being dried, L. kefir 8321 and L. kefir 8348 had a 
      decrease in viability of 0.29 and 0.70 log cfu/ml respectively, while the addition 
      of different protectants improved the survival of both strains significantly. During 
      storage, bacterial survival was significantly higher under lower conditions of RH 
      (0-11%), and monosodium glutamate and FOS proved to be the best protectants.

TI  - The effect of kefir on the activities of GSH-Px, GST, CAT, GSH and LPO levels in 
      carbon tetrachloride-induced mice tissues.
PG  - 412-6
AB  - Functional foods including kefir have increasingly become as popular as before in 
      the developing world. The health benefits of kefir including the antioxidative 
      effects are still under evaluation. Vitamin E is also a well-known antioxidant. The 
      biologically damaging effects of reactive oxygen species are controlled in vivo by a 
      wide spectrum of antioxidant defence mechanisms. Dietary constituents of 
      antioxidative vitamins and other nutrients may play an important role in protecting 
      the body against oxidative damage. The study was carried out to investigate the 
      protective effect of kefir against oxidative damage of CCl4 in mice, compared with 
      the well-known antioxidant vitamin E. Three-week-old Swiss Albino mice, weighing 
      22-26 g were used for the experiment. At the end of the microbiological analysis of 
      kefir, the averages of the total mesophilic aerobic colony counts, lactic acid 
      bacteria, lactic streptococci, enterococci, and yeasts were found to be 1.04 x 
      10(9), 9.87 x 10(8), 4.38 x 10(8), 7.80 x 10(4) and 1.26 x 10(5) CFU/ml, 
      respectively. While both vitamin E and kefir were found to have a protective effect 
      against CCl4-induced damage, kefir was more protective. This may probably be the 
      first study to compare the antioxidative action of kefir and vitamin E in the animal 
      model.

      following weaning.

LID - 10.1007/s11250-011-0039-3 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate effects of kefir, a traditional source of 
      probiotic, on coccidial oocysts excretion and on the performance of dairy goat kids 
      following weaning. Twin kids were randomly allocated to one of two groups at 
      weaning. Kids of the first group received 20 ml of kefir daily for 6 weeks (KEF), 
      while kids in the control group were given a placebo (CON). Individual faecal 
      samples were regularly (n = 18 per kid) taken to quantify the number of coccidial 
      oocysts per gram of faeces (OpG). There were no differences between the groups in 
      terms of body weight development (P > 0.05) and feed consumption. Kids of both 
      groups were not able to consume enough feed to meet their nutrient requirements 
      during the first 3 weeks following weaning. KEF had a lower frequency of OpG 
      positive samples than CON (P = 0.043). Kefir did not affect the maximum oocyst 
      excretion and age of the kids at the highest oocyst excretion (P > 0.05). KEF shed 
      numerically 35% lower coccidial oocysts than the controls, which corresponded to a 
      statistical tendency (P = 0.074) in lowering Log-OpG in comparison to CON. While KEF 
      had a lower frequency of OpG positive samples and tended to shed lower OPG by around 
      one-third, the frequency of diarrhea, level of highest oocyst excretion, and 
      performance of the kids remained unaffected. Therefore, it is concluded that overall 
      effects of kefir do not have a significant impact on sub-clinical infection and 
      performance in weaned kids under relatively high-hygienic farming conditions.

AB  - The objective of this research was to investigate the effects microbial 
      transglutaminase (m-TGs) on the physicochemical, microbial and sensory properties of 
      kefir produced by using mix cow and soymilk. Kefir batches were prepared using 0, 
      0.5, 1 and 1.5 Units m-TGs for per g of milk protein. Adding m-TGs to milk caused an 
      increase in the pH and viscosity and caused a decrease in titratable acidity and 
      syneresis in the kefir samples. Total bacteria, lactobacilli and streptococci counts 
      decreased, while yeast counts increased in all the samples during storage. Alcohols 
      and acids compounds have increased in all the samples except in the control samples, 
      while carbonyl compounds have decreased in all the samples during storage (1-30 d). 
      The differences in the percentage of alcohols, carbonyl compounds and acids in total 
      volatiles on the 1st and the 30th d of storage were observed at 8.47-23.52%, 
      6.94-25.46% and 59.64-63.69%, respectively. The consumer evaluation of the kefir 
      samples showed that greater levels of acceptability were found for samples which had 
      been added 1.5 U m-TGs for per g of milk protein.

TI  - Polyphasic characterization of the lactic acid bacteria in kefir.
PG  - 59-68
AB  - The lactic acid bacteria of kefir were isolated and characterized using 
      phenotypical, biochemical, and genotypical methods. Polyphasic analyses of results 
      permitted the identification of the microflora to the strain level. The genus 
      Lactobacillus was represented by the species Lb. kefir and Lb. kefiranofaciens. Both 
      subspecies of Lactococcus lactis (lactis and cremoris) were isolated. Leuconostoc 
      mesenteroides subsp. cremoris was also found. The kefir studied contained few 
      species of lactic acid bacteria but showed a high number of different strains. We 
      found that the polyphasic analysis approach increases the confidence in strain 
      determination. It helped confirm strain groupings and it showed that it could have 
      an impact on the phylogeny of the strains.

TI  - Antiobesity Effect of Prebiotic Polyphenol-Rich Grape Seed Flour Supplemented with 
      Probiotic Kefir-Derived Lactic Acid Bacteria.

AB  - The interaction between prebiotics and probiotics may exert synergistic health 
      benefits. This study investigated the combined effects of polyphenol-rich wine grape 
      seed flour (GSF), a prebiotic, and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) derived from kefir, a 
      probiotic, on obesity-related metabolic disease in high-fat diet (HFD) induced obese 
      (DIO) mice. DIO mice were fed with HFD with 6% microcrystalline cellulose (CON) or 
      HFD supplemented with GSF (5% or 10% GSF), HFD with LAB orally administrated (LAB), 
      or HFD with a combination of GSF and LAB orally administrated (GSF+LAB) for 9 weeks. 
      The vehicle, saline, was also orally administered to the CON and GSF groups. In 
      comparison to CON, all GSF and LAB groups showed a reduction ( P < 0.05) in 
      HF-induced weight gain, liver and adipose tissue weights, plasma lipid 
      concentrations, insulin resistance, and glucose intolerance. The combination of 10% 
      GSF and LAB showed synergistic effects ( P < 0.05) on body weight gain, plasma 
      insulin and total cholesterol concentrations, and cecum propionate contents. Plasma 
      zonulin and cecum propionate concentrations and intestinal FXR gene expression were 
      ( P < 0.05) correlated with body weight gain. A pathway analysis of microarray data 
      of adipose tissue showed that the combination of GSF and LAB affected genes involved 
      in metabolic and immunological diseases, including inflammasome complex assembly ( P 
      < 0.05). In conclusion, a combination of GSF and LAB inhibited HF-induced obesity 
      and inflammation via alterations in intestinal permeability and adipocyte gene 
      expression.

TI  - Bioprocess development and preservation of functional food from tomato seed isolate 
      fermented by kefir culture mixture.
PG  - 3911-3921
LID - 10.1007/s13197-018-3315-7 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this work was to explore the use of protein isolate from tomato seed 
      enriched with the sucrose and the ascorbic acid as a medium for the growth of kefir 
      mixture culture to develop a new non-dairy functional food. Unstructured 
      mathematical and logistic models were proposed to describe cell growth, kefiran 
      production, nutriment consumption and antioxidant activity. It was found that the 
      maximal cell mass in the culture reached 8.38 g L(-1) after 24 h of fermentation. A 
      significant amount of kefiran was also produced (0.65 g L(-1)). The kefir culture 
      growth significantly decreased protein content and enhanced the antioxidant activity 
      during varied fermentation through the production of bio active peptides. After 24 h 
      of fermentation, IC(50) value for protein isolate was estimated to be about 
      10.48 µg mL(-1). The proposed models adequately described the changes during 
      fermentation and as observed as a promising approach for the formulation of tomato 
      seed-based functional foods. The preservation of the isolate was also investigated 
      through a spray-drying process. The effect of spray-drying on the viability of 
      lactic acid bacteria and stability of protein content and the antioxidant activity 
      of the powder was also carried out. Results showed that the spray-drying method has 
      great potential for the synthesis of powder from the fermented isolate that are rich 
      in desirable properties. However, it was appropriate to preserve the powder for 
      10 days at 37 °C for the preservation of protein functionality.

      isolated from kefir.
PG  - 102-8

AB  - Kefir is obtained by milk fermentation with a complex microbial population included 
      in a matrix of polysaccharide and proteins. Several health-promoting activities has 
      been attributed to kefir consumption. The aim of this study was to select 
      microorganisms from kefir able to down-regulate intestinal epithelial innate 
      response and further characterize this activity. Caco-2 cells stably transfected 
      with a human CCL20 promoter luciferase reporter were used to screen a collection of 
      24 yeast and 23 bacterial strains isolated from kefir. The Toll-like receptor 5 
      agonist, flagellin was used to activate the reporter cells, while pre-incubation 
      with the selected strains was tested to identify strains with the capacity to 
      inhibit cell activation. In this system, 21 yeast strains from the genera 
      Saccharomyces, Kluyveromyces and Issatchenkia inhibited almost 100% of the 
      flagellin-dependent activation, whereas only some lactobacilli strains showed a 
      partial effect. K. marxianus CIDCA 8154 was selected for further characterization. 
      Inhibitory activity was confirmed at transcriptional level on Caco-2/TC-7 and HT-29 
      cells upon flagellin stimulation. A similar effect was observed using other 
      pro-inflammatory stimulation such as IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. Pre-incubation with 
      yeasts induced a down-regulation of NF-kappaB signalling in epithelial cells in 
      vitro, as well as expression of other pro-inflammatory chemokines such as CXCL8 and 
      CXCL2. Furthermore, modulation of CCL20 mRNA expression upon flagellin stimulation 
      was evidenced in vivo, in a mouse ligated intestinal loop model. Results indicate 
      kefir contains microorganisms able to abolish the intestinal epithelial inflammatory 
      response that could explain some of the properties attributed to this fermented 
      milk.

TI  - The protective effect of fermented milk kefir on radiation-induced apoptosis in 
      colonic crypt cells of rats.
PG  - 111-5
AB  - To evaluate the effect of fermented milk kefir on X-ray-induced apoptosis in the 
      colon of rats, we examined the apoptotic index, the mean number of apoptotic cells 
      detected by H&E staining per crypt in the colon, in control rats and 
      kefir-pretreated rats drinking kefir for 12 days before irradiation. Apoptotic cells 
      were confirmed by TUNEL staining, and active caspase-3 expression was studied by 
      immunohistochemistry. The cell position of apoptotic cells and active caspase-3 
      positive cells were examined. The apoptotic index of kefir-treated rats was 
      significantly (p < 0.05) decreased 2 h after 1 Gy irradiation in comparison with 
      control rats at crypt cell positions 1-3, 5-7, 13, and 15. Active caspase-3 
      expression in the kefir-treated rats was also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in 
      comparison with control rats 2 h after 1 Gy irradiation at crypt cell positions 1-4, 
      13, and 15. This study indicated that kefir protects colonic crypt cells against 
      radiation-induced apoptosis, which was most pronounced in the stem cell region of 
      the crypt. The antiapoptotic effect of fermented milk kefir was due to the 
      inhibition of caspase-3 activation.

AB  - Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis is one of the most important starter bacteria used in 
      dairy technology and it is of great economic importance because of its use in the 
      production of dairy products, including cheese, butter, cream, and fermented milks. 
      Numerous studies have evaluated the biochemical and probiotic properties of 
      lactococci; however, limited studies on the probiotic characteristics of lactococci 
      were conducted using strains originating from raw milk and dairy products. 
      Characterizing the probiotic properties of strains isolated from raw milk and 
      fermented milk products is important in terms of selecting starter culture strains 
      for the production of functional dairy products. In this study, biochemical 
      properties (including antibiotic sensitivity, lipolytic activity, amino acid 
      decarboxylation, antioxidant activity) and probiotic properties (including 
      antimicrobial activity, growth in the presence of bile salts, bile salts 
      deconjugation, and hydrophobicity) of 14 Lactococcus lactis strains isolated from 
      raw milk and kefir grains were investigated. Strains originating from kefir grains 
      had better characteristics in terms of antimicrobial activity and bile salt 
      deconjugation, whereas strains from raw milk had better hydrophobicity and 
      antioxidant activity characteristics. None of the strains were able to grow in the 
      presence of bile salt and did not show amino acid decarboxylation or lipolytic 
      activities. Biochemical and probiotic properties of L. lactis strains varied 
      depending on the strain and some of these strains could be used as functional 
      cultures depending on their properties. However, these strains did not possess all 
      of the properties required to meet the definition of a probiotic.

TI  - Inhibitory activity of cheese whey fermented with kefir grains.

LID - 10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-10-121 [doi]
AB  - We investigated the chemical and microbiological compositions of three types of whey 
      to be used for kefir fermentation as well as the inhibitory capacity of their 
      subsequent fermentation products against 100 Salmonella sp. and 100 Escherichia coli 
      pathogenic isolates. All the wheys after fermentation with 10% (wt/vol) kefir grains 
      showed inhibition against all 200 isolates. The content of lactic acid bacteria in 
      fermented whey ranged from 1.04 × 10(7) to 1.17 × 10(7) CFU/ml and the level of 
      yeasts from 2.05 × 10(6) to 4.23 × 10(6) CFU/ml. The main changes in the chemical 
      composition during fermentation were a decrease in lactose content by 41 to 48% 
      along with a corresponding lactic acid production to a final level of 0.84 to 1.20% 
      of the total reaction products. The MIC was a 30% dilution of the fermentation 
      products for most of the isolates, while the MBC varied between 40 and 70%, 
      depending on the isolate. The pathogenic isolates Salmonella enterica serovar 
      Enteritidis 2713 and E. coli 2710 in the fermented whey lost their viability after 2 
      to 7 h of incubation. When pathogens were deliberately inoculated into whey before 
      fermentation, the CFU were reduced by 2 log cycles for E. coli and 4 log cycles for 
      Salmonella sp. after 24 h of incubation. The inhibition was mainly related to lactic 
      acid production. This work demonstrated the possibility of using kefir grains to 
      ferment an industrial by-product in order to obtain a natural acidic preparation 
      with strong bacterial inhibitory properties that also contains potentially probiotic 
      microorganisms.

AB  - Water kefir is a mildly sour and alcoholic drink fermented by a stable microbial 
      multispecies community. With its high sugar content and low amino acid concentration 
      water kefir medium represents a demanding habitat. In this ecological niche only 
      well adapted microorganisms which are fit to the consortium are able to grow and 
      mutually provide essential nutrients. The synergism between main representatives of 
      water kefir yeasts and lactobacilli was studied in a co-culture model system. 
      Co-cultivation of yeasts and lactobacilli in water kefir medium significantly 
      increased cell yield of all interaction partners, delineating the interaction of 
      these water kefir isolates as mutualism. The support of Zygotorulaspora (Z.) 
      florentina was due to the acidification of the medium by the lactobacilli, whereas 
      lactobacilli are improved in growth by the disposal of essential nutrients produced 
      by yeasts. The trophic interaction between Lactobacillus (Lb.) hordei and yeasts is 
      constituted by the release of amino acids and Vitamin B6 from yeasts, whereas Lb. 
      nagelii is supported in growth by their production of amino acids. The interaction 
      of Z. florentina and Lb. nagelii was further examined to reveal that co-cultivation 
      induced the yeast to release arginine, which was essential for Lb. nagelii.

TI  - Formation of volatile compounds in kefir made of goat and sheep milk with high 
      polyunsaturated fatty acid content.

AB  - This article explored the formation of volatile compounds during the production of 
      kefir from goat and sheep milks with high polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as a 
      result of feeding animals forage supplemented with maize dried distillers grains 
      with solubles (DDGS). The increased PUFA content of the goat and sheep milks 
      resulted in significant changes to the fermentation process. In particular, apart 
      from an increase in the time taken to ferment sheep milk, fermentation yielded less 
      2,3-butanedione. The highest quantities of this compound were assayed in kefir 
      produced from goat milk with an increased content of PUFA. An increase of PUFA 
      significantly elevated ethanal synthesis during lactose-alcohol fermentation of 
      sheep milk. Neither the origin of milk (sheep or goat) nor the level of PUFA had any 
      statistical effect on the amount of ethanal assayed during the fermentation of milk 
      and within the finished product. The proportion of l(+)-lactic acid was higher in 
      kefirs produced using goat milk compared with sheep milk and did not depend on the 
      content of PUFA in milk fat. The content of PUFA had a significant effect on the 
      aroma profile of the resulting kefirs. An increase in PUFA content resulted in the 
      loss of whey aroma in goat milk kefirs and the animal odor in sheep milk kefirs, and 
      a creamy aroma became more prevalent in kefirs made from sheep milk.

AB  - Gastrointestinal conditions along the digestive tract are the main stress to which 
      probiotics administrated orally are exposed because they must survive these adverse 
      conditions and arrive alive to the intestine. Adhesion to epithelium has been 
      considered one of the key criteria for the characterization of probiotics because it 
      extends their residence time in the intestine and as a consequence, can influence 
      the health of the host by modifying the local microbiota or modulating the immune 
      response. Nevertheless, there are very few reports on the adhesion properties to 
      epithelium and mucus of microorganisms after passing through the gastrointestinal 
      tract. In the present work, we evaluate the adhesion ability in vitro of L. 
      paracasei strains isolated from kefir grains after acid and bile stress and we 
      observed that they survive simulated gastrointestinal passage in different levels 
      depending on the strain. L. paracasei CIDCA 8339, 83120 and 83123 were more 
      resistant than L. paracasei CIDCA 83121 and 83124, with a higher susceptibility to 
      simulated gastric conditions. Proteomic analysis of L. paracasei subjected to acid 
      and bile stress revealed that most of the proteins that were positively regulated 
      correspond to the glycolytic pathway enzymes, with an overall effect of stress on 
      the activation of the energy source. Moreover, it is worth to remark that after 
      gastrointestinal passage, L. paracasei strains have increased their ability to 
      adhere to mucin and epithelial cells in vitro being this factor of relevance for 
      maintenance of the strain in the gut environment to exert its probiotic action.

AB  - Kefir is an association of microrganisms generally grown in milk, with known 
      probiotic activities identified from its soured suspensions. Aqueous media are also 
      able to grow kefir, but little is known about the probiotic properties of its 
      fermented products. This work aimed to evaluate some probiotic properties of a 
      carbohydrate fraction isolated from sugary kefir (sugary kefir carbohydrate [SKC]). 
      Anti-inflammatory activity of the isolated fraction of carbohydrate was tested both 
      in vitro (cellular respirometry and macrophage culture) and in vivo (50% effective 
      dose, rat paw edema, vascular permeability, and cicatrizing test). The results 
      indicated no significant difference for oxygen uptake or macrophage culture between 
      control and test groups. Rat paw edema, however, showed a significant inhibitory 
      activity by 30 +/- 4% and 54 +/- 8% (P < .001) for carrageenan and dextran, 
      respectively. In the cicatrizing test, animals treated with SKC cream also presented 
      less trauma after treatments as compared to the negative control group (P < .05). 
      The overall data suggested the SKC as a natural product that could be used as a 
      constituent of an anti-inflammatory compound.

TI  - The effects of oral plain kefir supplementation on proinflammatory cytokine 
      properties of the hyperglycemia Wistar rats induced by streptozotocin.
PG  - 100-4
AB  - AIM: to validate the effect of plain kefir on immune responses of hyperglycemia 
      wistar rats induced by Streptozotocin. METHODS: the randomized pretest - posttest 
      control group study design was conducted in male hyperglycemia Wistar rats induced 
      by streptozotocin (STZ). Rats were randomized into four groups: (1) STZ-induced 
      group were given insulin treatment 0.76 UI/200 g bw, (2) STZ-induced group and 
      treated with plain kefir 3.6 cc/200 g bw/day for 30 days, (3) STZ-induced group as 
      control, (4) normal animal group as a negative control. Blood glucose was measured 
      from whole blood that was taken 0.1 ml from retroorbitalis vein by microhematocrit 
      on day 1 (pretest) and day 30 (post test) by enzymatic methods. Immune responses 
      (cytokines IL1, IL6, IL10, TNF) were measured by ELISA. Data were analyzed by one 
      way Anova, Mann Whitney test and Duncan with significant level of p<0.05. RESULTS: 
      plain kefir supplementation 3.6 cc/day affect blood glucose, proinflamatory 
      cytokines (IL1, IL6, TNF) and antiinflamatory cytokine (IL10). Statistical analysis 
      showed decrease of glucose -111.00±44.23 ml (p<0.001) and proinflamatory cytokines 
      IL1 about -18.62±23.59 and IL6 -3.21±7.57 mU/mL (p<0.001), respectively compared to 
      the control groups. TNF decreased 1.65±4.62 mU/mL, but not significant (p>0.05), 
      except for controls group. In addition, antiinflammatory (IL10) showed also increase 
      about 15.11±2.16 (p<0.05), except for the control. CONCLUSION: plain kefir 
      supplementation significantly decreased blood glucose, level of cytokines (IL1, IL6) 
      and lowered TNF level. On the contrary, the level of IL10 is increased compare to 
      control groups.

TI  - Evaluation of different preservation techniques on the storage potential of Kefir 
      grains.
PG  - 125-8
AB  - Kefir is an acidic, mildly alcoholic dairy beverage produced by the fermentation of 
      milk with a grain-like starter culture (Koroleva, 1988). These grains usually 
      contain a relatively stable and specific balance of microbes that exist in a complex 
      symbiotic relationship (Obermann & Libudzisz, 1998; Witthuhn et al. 2004). The 
      different groups of microbes present in the grains are active at different stages of 
      the fermentation (Koroleva, 1982). The lactococci, including Lactococcus lactis 
      subsp. lactis, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris and Lc. lactis subsp. diacetilactis 
      provide rapid acid development during the first hours of the fermentation 
      (Litopoulou-Tzanetaki & Tzanetakis, 2000). As the acidity of the milk increases it 
      provides favourable conditions for the growth of the lactobacilli (Rea et al. 1996). 
      The yeasts, acetic acid bacteria and the aroma-producing microbes, mainly 
      leuconostocs, have a much slower growth rate than the lactic acid producers, 
      resulting in the slow production of the aroma compounds and the gradual increase in 
      the concentration of these substances in the later stages of the fermentation 
      (Koroleva, 1982). In the past the preservation of the microbial populations present 
      in the traditional Kefir grains was achieved by methods including freezing (Garrote 
      et al. 1997), lyophilisation (Oberman & Libudzisz, 1998), air-drying (Kroger, 1993) 
      and refrigeration (Marshall, 1993). Research has shown that traditional Kefir grains 
      preserved by air-drying and lyophilisation retain their activity for up to 12-18 
      months (Oberman & Libudzisz, 1998). Frozen grains stored at -20 degrees C were found 
      to maintain the microbial activity for up to 7-8 months, whereas grains stored at 
      refrigerated temperatures showed a decreased activity after about 10 d (Oberman & 
      Libudzisz, 1998). The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of four different 
      preservation techniques on the activity of mass cultured Kefir grains (Schoevers & 
      Britz, 2003). The activity of the grains was evaluated at different time intervals 
      using four activity measurements, including changes in substrate pH, titratable 
      acidity (TA), lactose and lactic acid levels of the final Kefir beverage.

TI  - Selected Lactobacillus strains isolated from sugary and milk kefir reduce Salmonella 
      infection of epithelial cells in vitro.
PG  - 585-95
LID - 10.3920/BM2015.0196 [doi]
AB  - The isolation of potentially probiotic strains and the subsequent study of their 
      properties are very important steps to gain insight in the health benefits ascribed 
      to sugary and milk kefir. The aim of the present study was to characterise fifteen 
      Lactobacillus strains isolated from these beverages by determining some surface 
      properties and their ability to antagonise enterocyte cell damage after Salmonella 
      infection in vitro. Lactobacillus surface properties were determined by 
      hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, and coaggregation assays with Salmonella. In 
      addition, lactobacilli adhesion to Caco-2/TC-7 cells and the effect on Salmonella 
      invasion were evaluated. Finally, the disassembly of F-actin cytoskeleton on 
      intestinal epithelial cells was assayed in vitro when Salmonella infection was 
      performed in the presence of selected Lactobacillus strains. Ten out of the 15 
      strains showed a high adhesion capacity to Caco-2/TC-7 cells. Most of the strains 
      were hydrophilic and non-autoaggregating. Strains isolated from sugary kefir were 
      non-coaggregating with Salmonella, while strains Lactobacillus paracasei CIDCA 
      83120, 83121, 83123, 83124, 8339, 83102 isolated from milk kefir were able to 
      coaggregate after 1 h. L. paracasei CIDCA 8339 and Lactobacillus kefiri CIDCA 83102 
      were able to diminish Salmonella invasion to the enterocytes. An antagonistic effect 
      on cytoskeleton disruption elicited by the pathogen was also demonstrated. Our 
      results suggest that both strains isolated from milk kefir could be considered as 
      appropriate probiotic candidates.

AB  - About 100 strains of heterofermentative rod-shaped lactic acid bacteria have been 
      isolated from kefir grains and drink kefir, respectively. These isolates differ from 
      Lactobacillus brevis and the other species of heterofermentative lactobacilli so far 
      validly published with respect to biochemical characteristics and DNA/DNA homology. 
      They are thus considered as representatives of the new species Lactobacillus kefir 
      sp. nov., with strain DSM 20587 (= A/K) being the type strain.

TI  - Fermented milk, Kefram-Kefir enhances glucose uptake into insulin-responsive muscle 
      cells.
PG  - 107-16
LID - 10.1023/A:1023926407877 [doi]
AB  - Diminution of insulin-responses in the target organ is the primary cause of 
      non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).It is thought to be correlated to 
      the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this article, we 
      attempted to evaluate whether fermented milk, Kefram-Kefir known as an antioxidant, 
      reduces the cellular ROS levels and can stimulate the glucose uptake in L6 skeletal 
      muscle cells. Water-soluble or chloroform/methanol-extracted fractions from 
      Kefram-Kefir were examined to evaluate the glucose uptake ability of L6 myotubes.As 
      a result, the water-soluble fraction augmented the uptake of glucose in L6 myotubes 
      both in the presence and absence of insulin stimulation. Estimation of intracellular 
      ROS level revealed that the water-soluble fraction of Kefram-Kefir reduced the 
      intracellular ROS level on both the undifferentiated and differentiated L6 cells. 
      Especially, glucose uptake was augmented up to six times with the addition of 
      water-soluble fraction in the insulin-stimulated L6 myotubes. Glucose transport 
      determination revealed that the active agent in Kefram-Kefir was resistant to 
      autoclave and stable in pH range from 4 to 10, and the small molecule below the 
      molecular weight of 1000. Furthermore, this augmentation was inhibited in the 
      presence of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitor wortmannin. 
      Considering together with the reports that PI 3-kinase is locatedin the insulin 
      signaling pathway and the participation in the translocation of glucose transporter 
      4 to the cell membrane, it is suggested that the water-soluble fraction of 
      Kefram-Kefir activates PI 3-kinase or other upstream molecules in the insulin 
      signaling pathway, which resulted in the augmentation of glucose uptake and its 
      specific inhibition by wortmannin.

PG  - 364-9
AB  - Milk and MRS broth fermented with kefir grains from different households were 
      examined for inhibitory activity toward gram-negative and gram-positive strains. 
      Fermented milk obtained with 10 g per 100 ml of inoculum (final pH 3.32 to 4.25) and 
      MRS broth fermented with 1 and 10 g per 100 ml of inocula (final pH 4.18 to 5.25) 
      had inhibitory power demonstrated by spot test and agar well diffusion assay. This 
      inhibitory effect could be assigned to the undissociated form of lactic and acetic 
      acid produced during the fermentation process. Kefir supernatants inhibited the 
      growth of Escherichia coli 3 in nutrient broth at 37 degrees C for 24 h. However, 
      supernatants of yogurt or milk artificially acidified with lactic and acetic acids 
      allowed the growth of E. coli 3 in the same conditions. A bacteriostatic effect of 
      milk fermented with kefir grains over E. coli 3 was also demonstrated.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate yeast communities in kefir 
      grains and viili starters in Taiwan through conventional microbiological cultivation 
      and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). 
      The DNA sequencing was used as a validity technique to ensure that all isolates 
      within each group belonged to just one species, and to confirm the identified 
      results of PCR-DGGE. Results indicated that a combination of conventional 
      microbiological cultivation with PCR-DGGE and sequencing could successfully identify 
      4 yeast species from both types of cultures in Taiwan. Kluyveromyces marxianus, 
      Saccharomyces turicensis, and Pichia fermentans were found in Taiwanese kefir grains 
      with a distribution of 76, 22, and 2%, respectively, whereas Klu. marxianus, 
      Saccharomyces unisporus and P. fermentans were identified in viili starters 
      corresponding to 58, 11, and 31% of the total cell counts, respectively. 
      Furthermore, the culture-independent method was applied to identify the yeast 
      species using DGGE. Only 2 yeast species, Klu. marxianus and S. turicensis, were 
      found in kefir grains and 2, Klu. marxianus and P. fermentans, in viili starters. 
      These results suggest that in samples containing multiple species, PCR-DGGE may fail 
      to detect some species. Sequences of yeast isolates reported in this study have been 
      deposited in the GenBank database under accession nos. DQ139802, AF398485, DQ377652, 
      and AY007920.

AB  - An aqueous extract of Kefir, fermented milk originally produced in the Caucasus 
      mountains, suppressed morphological changes of human melanoma HMV-1 and SK-MEL cells 
      and human normal fibroblastTIG-1 cells caused by UVC-irradiation, suggesting that UV 
      damage can be suppressed by the Kefir extract. The addition of the Kefir extract 
      after UVC-irradiation of HVM-1 cells resulted in a remarkable decrease in 
      intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) which had been increased by UVC 
      irradiation. The Kefir extract also stimulated unscheduled DNA synthesis and 
      suppressed UVC-induced apoptosis of HMV-1 cells. A colony formation assay revealed 
      that the Kefir extract rescued HMV-1 cells from cell death caused by UVC 
      irradiation. The Kefir extract, as well as methyl methanethiosulfonate which is 
      known to enhance the nucleotide excision repair (NER) activity, exhibited strong 
      thymine dimer repair-enhancing activity. Epigalocatechin exhibited a weak NER 
      activity but vitamins A, C, and E and catechin showed no NER activity. The thymine 
      dimer repair-enhancing factors in the Kefir extract were heat-stable and assumed to 
      be molecules with a molecular weight of less than 5000. The treatment of HMV-1 cells 
      with the Kefir extract during or before UVC- irradiation also prevented the 
      generation of ROS and thymine dimmer, and suppressed the apoptosis of HMV-1 cells, 
      suggesting that application of Kefir can prevent UV damage.

AB  - The objective of this work was to optimize a fermented soy product formulation with 
      kefir and soy, oat and wheat fibers and to evaluate the fiber and product 
      characteristics. A simplex-centroid mixture design was used for the optimization. 
      Soymilk, soy, oat and wheat fiber mixtures, sucrose and anti-foaming agent were used 
      for the formulation, followed by thermal treatment, cooling and the addition of 
      flavoring. Fermentation was performed at 25 °C with a kefir culture until a pH of 
      4.5 was obtained. The products were cooled, homogenized and stored for analysis. 
      From the mathematical models and variables response surface and desirability an 
      optimal fermented product was formulated containing 3% (w/w) soy fiber. Compared 
      with the other formulations, soy fermented product with 3% soy fiber had the best 
      acidity, viscosity, syneresis, firmness and Lactococcus lactis count.

AB  - Kefir is a dairy product popular in many countries in Central Europe, especially in 
      Poland and other countries of Eastern and Northern Europe. This type of fermented 
      milk is produced by a complex population of symbiotic bacteria and yeasts. In this 
      work, conditions for DNA extraction, involving disruption of kefir grains and a 
      cascade of cell lysis treatments, were established. Extraction procedure of total 
      microbial DNA was carried out directly from fresh kefir grains. Using different 
      lysis stringency conditions, five DNA pools were obtained. Genetic diversity of DNA 
      pools were validated by RAPD analysis, which showed differences in patterns of 
      amplified DNA fragments, indicating diverse microbial composition of all the 
      analysed samples. These DNA pools were used for construction of genomic DNA 
      libraries for sequencing. As much as 50% of the analysed nucleotide sequences showed 
      homology to sequences from bacteria belonging to the Lactobacillus genus. Several 
      sequences were similar to sequences from bacteria representing Lactococcus, 
      Oenococcus, Pediococcus, Streptococcus and Leuconostoc species. Among homologues of 
      yeast proteins were those from Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Kluyveromyces 
      lactis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, several sequences were found to be 
      homologous to sequences from bacteriophages.

TI  - Evaluation of a potentially probiotic non-dairy beverage developed with honey and 
      kefir grains: Fermentation kinetics and storage study.
PG  - 732-742
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the fermentation process of honey with kefir 
      grains through a comprehensive understanding of its rheological properties, 
      probiotic cell viability, instrumental color parameters and kinetic aspects in a 
      batch bioreactor and during storage. The results showed that kefir grains were well 
      adapted to bioreactor conditions, reaching high levels of cell viability (over 10(6) 
      CFU mL(-1) for total yeast and bacteria), phenolic compounds content (190 GAE/100 g) 
      and acidification after 24 h of fermentation at 30 ℃. Colorimetric analysis showed 
      that lightness (L*) and redness (a*) remained constant, while yellowness intensities 
      (b*) decreased during fermentation time. After 35 days of storage, honey kefir 
      beverage maintained its chemical characteristics and microbial viability as required 
      to be classified as a probiotic product. The Ostwald-de-Waele (R(2 )≥ 0.98) and 
      Herschel-Bulkley (R(2 )≥ 0.99) models can be used to predict the behavior of honey 
      kefir beverage. The parameters analyzed in this study should be taken into account 
      for industrial production of this novel non-dairy beverage.

TI  - Identification and Characterization of Oleaginous Yeast Isolated from Kefir and Its 
      Ability to Accumulate Intracellular Fats in Deproteinated Potato Wastewater with 
      Different Carbon Sources.

AB  - The search for efficient oleaginous microorganisms, which can be an alternative to 
      fossil fuels and biofuels obtained from oilseed crops, has been going on for many 
      years. The suitability of microorganisms in this regard is determined by their 
      ability to biosynthesize lipids with preferred fatty acid profile along with the 
      concurrent utilization of energy-rich industrial waste. In this study, we isolated, 
      characterized, and identified kefir yeast strains using molecular biology 
      techniques. The yeast isolates identified were Candida inconspicua, Debaryomyces 
      hansenii, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Kazachstania unispora, and Zygotorulaspora 
      florentina. We showed that deproteinated potato wastewater, a starch processing 
      industry waste, supplemented with various carbon sources, including lactose and 
      glycerol, is a suitable medium for the growth of yeast, which allows an accumulation 
      of over 20% of lipid substances in its cells. Fatty acid composition primarily 
      depended on the yeast strain and the carbon source used, and, based on our results, 
      most of the strains met the criteria required for the production of biodiesel. In 
      particular, this concerns a significant share of saturated fatty acids, such as 
      C16:0 and C18:0, and unsaturated fatty acids, such as C18:1 and C18:2. The highest 
      efficiency in lipid biosynthesis exceeded 6.3 g L(-1). Kazachstania unispora was 
      able to accumulate the high amount of palmitoleic acid.

AB  - EPS-producing LAB are widely used in the dairy industry since these polymers improve 
      the viscosity and texture of the products. Besides, EPS might be responsible for 
      several health benefits attributed to probiotic strains. However, growth conditions 
      (culture media, temperature, pH) could modify EPS production affecting both 
      technological and probiotic properties. In this work, the influence of growth 
      temperature on EPS production was evaluated, as well as the consequences of these 
      changes in the probiotic properties of the strains. All Lactobacillus paracasei 
      strains used in the study showed changes in EPS production caused by growth 
      temperature, evidenced by the appearance of a high molecular weight fraction and an 
      increment in the total amount of produced EPS at lower temperature. Nevertheless, 
      these changes do not affect the probiotic properties of the strains; L. paracasei 
      strains grown at 20 °C, 30 °C and 37 °C were able to survive in simulated 
      gastrointestinal conditions, to adhere to Caco-2 cells after that treatment and to 
      modulate the epithelial innate immune response. The results suggest that selected 
      L. paracasei strains are new probiotic candidates that can be used in a wide range 
      of functional foods in which temperature could be used as a tool to improve the 
      technological properties of the product.

AB  - In this work, the analysis of alkylphenols, bisphenols and alkylphenol ethoxylates 
      in bottled waters, kombuchas and water kefir was performed through a vortex-assisted 
      dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction method based on a natural hydrophobic 
      eutectic solvent. For this purpose, mixtures of monoterpenes and fatty acids were 
      employed. Different factors affecting extraction were optimized and the method was 
      validated in terms of matrix effect, linearity, limits of detection and recovery. 
      Recovery values varied between 70.0 and 124.3% (except for 4-tert-butylphenol: 67.0% 
      and 4-n-nonylphenol: 60.8% in water kefir) and limits of detection were in the range 
      0.10 ng/L - 2.99 µg/L. Finally, 8 bottled waters, 8 kombuchas and 4 water kefirs 
      were analyzed and 4-tert-octylphenol monoethoxylate was detected in water 
      (20.28 ± 0.99 - 62.08 ± 3.63 µg/L). This is the first application analyzing 
      xenobiotic contaminants in kombucha and water kefir and the first time in which the 
      three types of compounds are simultaneously extracted by dispersive liquid-liquid 
      microextraction.

AB  - Mixture of pomegranate juice and whey was evaluated as a potential substrate for 
      production of a novel beverage by kefir grains. The effects of two different 
      variables, fermentation, temperature (19 and 25 °C) and kefir grain amount (5 %w/v 
      and 8 %w/v), on total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activities of beverage 
      were examined during a fermentation time of 32 h. TPC and antioxidant activities 
      including 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging, reducing power, 
      inhibition effect upon linoleic acid autoxidation and inhibition effect upon 
      ascorbate autoxidation increased significantly (p < 0.05) during fermentation, but 
      metal chelating effect showed no significant difference. The highest increases were 
      observed when the temperature of 25 °C and kefir grain amount of 8 %w/v were 
      applied. Results proved antioxidant activities of beverages were desirable and 
      fermentation by kefir grains has the ability to enhance these antioxidant 
      activities, as compared with unfermented beverage. Also pomegranate juice and whey 
      were suitable media for producing a novel dairy-juice beverage.

TI  - Oral administration of freeze-dried kefir reduces intestinal permeation of and oral 
      sensitization to ovalbumin in mice.
PG  - 249-51
AB  - An increase in plasma ovalbumin concentrations after intragastric administration of 
      ovalbumin was suppressed by concomitant freeze-dried kefir in BALB/c mice. Serum 
      levels of ovalbumin-specific immunoglobulin G and proliferation of splenic 
      mononuclear cells in mice immunized orally with ovalbumin were suppressed by feeding 
      freeze-dried kefir. We propose that kefir reduces intestinal permeation of food 
      antigen, which contributes to suppression of oral sensitization.

AB  - An easy-to-use method for quantitative analysis of bacterial exopolysaccharides 
      (EPS) was developed. The acid treatment was resultant in removing proteins and 
      lactose and allowed to avoid long-term operation as dialysis. It was shown that, as 
      opposed to anthron and phenol-sulphuric acid methods, reducing sugars method after 
      EPS hydrolysis with glucose as standard provided reliable results, no matter to the 
      EPS monosaccharide composition. EPS quantity in kefir of different brands was varied 
      greatly, approximately at 50-200 mg/l, showing potential to enhance kefiran 
      production by alteration of technological process. The temperature optimum for EPS 
      production by kefir grains and kefir starter was about 30 °C, while the rise of 
      temperature increased soluble EPS in culturing media by means of extraction from 
      kefir grain body.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the role of commercially available kefir, a fermented milk 
      similar to yogurt but containing different fermentation microbes, in preventing 
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD). Probiotics have shown some promise in 
      preventing AAD. DESIGN: A double-blinded randomized placebo-controlled allocation 
      concealment clinical trial. SETTING: Primary care patients in the Washington, DC, 
      metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 125 children aged 1 to 5 years 
      presenting to primary care physicians. Intervention Kefir drink or heat-killed 
      matching placebo. Main Outcome Measure The primary outcome was the incidence of 
      diarrhea during the 14-day follow-up period in children receiving antibiotics. 
      RESULTS: There were no differences in the rates of diarrhea per group, with 18% in 
      the active group and 21.9% in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.82; 95% confidence 
      interval, 0.54-1.43). Additionally, there were no differences in any secondary 
      outcomes among the groups. However, there were some interesting interactions among 
      initial health at enrollment, age of participants, and sex that require further 
      study. CONCLUSIONS: In our trial, kefir did not prevent AAD. Further independent 
      research on the potential of kefir needs to be conducted.

LID - 10.1007/s00253-016-7956-z [doi]
AB  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens XL10, with a high yield of extracellular 
      polysaccharide (EPS), is isolated from Tibetan kefir grain and benefits the health 
      of human beings and has been considered to exhibit probiotic potential in vitro and 
      in vivo. The probiotic function of the strain was studied extensively, viz., acid 
      and bile salt tolerances, cell surface hydrophobicity and autoaggregation, the 
      modulation of gut microbiota, and the distribution and colonization of XL10 in the 
      mouse intestinal tract after oral administration. XL10 could survive 3-h incubation 
      at pH 3.5 and exhibited cell surface hydrophobicity of ∼79.9% and autoaggregation of 
      ∼27.8%. After continuous oral administration of XL10 for 2 weeks, the 
      Bifidobacteriaceae family increased, accompanied by an observable decline in 
      Proteobacteria phyla in the tested mice. Butyrivibrio and Pseudobutyrivibrio, 
      recognized as butyric acid-producing bacteria, could also be detected at day 7 and 
      day 14, respectively. The most abundant community in the mouse gut had formed by day 
      14. Additionally, we found that XL10 successfully adhered to the mucous tissue and 
      colonized the ileum of the mice based on fluorescence imaging, flow cytometry, and 
      qPCR. Our results suggested that XL10 has excellent probiotic properties and 
      represents an alternative for exploitation in the development of novel functional 
      foods.

TI  - Chemical, Physiochemical, and Microstructural Properties, and Probiotic 
      Survivability of Fermented Goat Milk Using Polymerized Whey Protein and Starter 
      Culture Kefir Mild 01.
PG  - 2650-2658
LID - 10.1111/1750-3841.13935 [doi]
AB  - A set-type fermented goat milk (FGM) using polymerized whey protein (PWP) as main 
      thickening agent and Kefir Mild 01 as starter culture was developed. The FGM with 
      PWP (0.3%, w/v) and pectin (0.2%, w/v) had low syneresis (5.44 ± 0.92%), desirable 
      viscosity (952.86 ± 61.52 mPa⋅s), and hardness (112.57 ± 3.23 g), which were 
      comparable to a fermented cow milk. Sensory evaluation data showed that the FGM with 
      PWP and pectin had higher scores of both flavor (4.41 ± 0.39) and taste (3.72 ± 
      0.34) than the sample without PWP. Chemical composition of both fermented goat and 
      cow milk were analyzed. The protein content of goat and cow milk samples were 3.50% 
      ± 0.12% and 3.28% ± 0.09% (w/w), respectively. Lactobacillus acidophilus population 
      in both FGM samples remained above 10(6) CFU/g during the 1st 4-wk storage. There 
      was a slight but no significant (P > 0.05) decrease in pH and TA during storage. 
      Scanning electron microscopy micrographs displayed a compact and homogeneous protein 
      network of the FGM with PWP and pectin. Polymerized whey protein may be a novel 
      protein-based thickening agent for formulation of a set-type FGM with starter 
      culture Kefir Mild 01. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Fermented goat milk is an increasingly 
      popular dairy product in the world. However, it is difficult to make set type 
      fermented goat milk due to the smaller size and lower content of casein micelles in 
      goat milk. A fermented goat milk with PWP (0.3%, w/v) and pectin (0.2%, w/v) was 
      successfully developed in this study. The product fermented by Kefir Mild 01 starter 
      culture had a similar taste with Kefir but no yeast or alcoholic exists. The new 
      product would be a promising food in the market.

TI  - Comparison of biotransformation of inorganic selenium by Lactobacillus and 
      Saccharomyces in lactic fermentation process of yogurt and kefir.
PG  - 8728-36

AB  - The aim of the present study was to characterize, quantify, and compare the 
      different selenium species that are produced when lactic fermentation with two 
      different types of microorganisms, bacteria (Lactobacillus) and yeast 
      (Saccharomyces), take place to produce yogurt and kefir, respectively, and to study 
      the transformation process of these species as a function of time. These two dairy 
      products were chosen for the study because they are highly consumed in different 
      cultures. Moreover, the microorganisms present in the fermentation processes are 
      different. While the bacteria Lactobacillus is the one responsible for yogurt 
      fermentation, a partnership between bacteria and the yeast Saccharomyces causes 
      kefir fermentation. A comparative study has been carried out by fermenting Se(IV) 
      enriched milk in the presence of both types of microorganisms, where the 
      concentration range studied was from 0.5 to 20 microg g (-1). Enzymatic extraction 
      enabled selenium speciation profiles, obtained by anionic exchange and ion-pairing 
      reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (IP-RP-HPLC) with inductively 
      coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection. Scanning electron microscopy 
      (SEM) applied to the enriched samples showed segregated Se (0), at added 
      concentrations higher than 5 microg g (-1). The main Se species formed depended on 
      the type of microorganism involved in the fermentation process, SeCys 2 and MeSeCys 
      being the main species generated in yogurt and SeMet in kefir. The results obtained 
      are different for both kinds of samples. Lactic fermentation for yogurt produced an 
      increment in selenocystine (SeCys 2) and Se-methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys), while 
      fermentation to produce kefir also incremented the selenomethionine (SeMet) 
      concentration. The Se species are stable for at least 10 and 15 days for kefir and 
      yogurt, respectively. After this period, selenocystine concentration decreased, and 
      the concentration of Se-methylselenocysteine was found to significantly increase.

AB  - Whey valorization concerns have led to recent interest on the production of whey 
      beverage simulating kefir. In this study, the structure and microbiota of Brazilian 
      kefir grains and beverages obtained from milk and whole/deproteinised whey was 
      characterized using microscopy and molecular techniques. The aim was to evaluate its 
      stability and possible shift of probiotic bacteria to the beverages. Fluorescence 
      staining in combination with Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy showed distribution 
      of yeasts in macro-clusters among the grain's matrix essentially composed of 
      polysaccharides (kefiran) and bacteria. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis 
      displayed communities included yeast affiliated to Kluyveromyces marxianus, 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kazachatania unispora, bacteria affiliated to 
      Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens subsp. Kefirgranum, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens 
      subsp. Kefiranofaciens and an uncultured bacterium also related to the genus 
      Lactobacillus. A steady structure and dominant microbiota, including probiotic 
      bacteria, was detected in the analyzed kefir beverages and grains. This robustness 
      is determinant for future implementation of whey-based kefir beverages.

TI  - Study of cytokines involved in the prevention of a murine experimental breast cancer 
      by kefir.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - Previous studies have shown that compounds released during milk fermentation by 
      Lactobacillus helveticus are implicated in the antitumour effect of this product. 
      Here the effects of the consumption, during 2 or 7 days, of kefir or kefir cell-free 
      fraction (KF) on the systemic and local immune responses in mammary glands and 
      tumours using a murine hormone-dependent breast cancer model were studied. In the 
      tumour control group, mice did not receive these products. At the end of the feeding 
      period, mice were injected subcutaneously with tumour cells in the mammary gland. 
      Four days post-injection, they received kefir or KF on a cyclical basis. Rate of 
      tumour development, cytokines in serum; mammary gland tissue, and tumour isolated 
      cells were monitored. Two-day cyclical administration of both products delayed 
      tumour growth. Both kefir and KF increased IL-10 in serum and decreased IL-6(+) 
      cells (cytokine involved in oestrogen synthesis) in mammary glands. Two-day cyclical 
      administration of KF increased IL-10(+) cells in mammary glands and in tumours and 
      decreased IL-6(+) cells in tumour. This study demonstrated the modulatory capacity 
      of KF on the immune response in mammary glands and tumours and the importance of the 
      administration period to obtain this effect.

TI  - Study of immune cells involved in the antitumor effect of kefir in a murine breast 
      cancer model.
PG  - 1920-8
AB  - Administration of kefir and a kefir cell-free fraction (KF) to mice injected with 
      breast tumor cells produced, locally in the mammary gland, different profiles of 
      cells secreting cytokines. Here, the immune cell populations in mammary glands 
      affected by the cyclic consumption of kefir or KF for 2 or 7 d were evaluated using 
      a breast tumor model. Apoptosis was also assayed as another mechanism involved in 
      tumor growth delay. The rate development of tumor cells, IgA(+) cells, and CD4+ and 
      CD8+ T lymphocytes was monitored in mammary gland tissues. The number of Bcl-2(+) 
      cells in the mammary gland was compared with the apoptosis observed in the tumor. 
      Two-day cyclical administration of both products delayed tumor growth and increased 
      the number of IgA(+) cells in the mammary gland. Changes in the balance between CD4+ 
      and CD8+ cells in the mammary gland were observed in mice from the group fed KF 
      cyclically for 2 d, such that the number of CD4+ cells increased when the number of 
      CD8+ cells remained constant. Mice that received 2-d cyclic administration of KF 
      showed significant increases in the number of apoptotic cells and decreases in 
      Bcl-2(+) cells in the mammary gland, compared with the tumor control group. The 
      present study allows a better understanding of the mechanisms (immune and nonimmune) 
      involved in the antitumor effect observed in mice administered kefir or KF. The 
      importance of nonmicrobial components released during milk fermentation to obtain 
      the beneficial antitumor effects is also reported.

PG  - 67-75
AB  - The effect of microbial beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.23) activity on intestinal 
      lactose digestion was estimated directly by following post-prandial venous plasma 
      galactose concentrations. To avoid superimposing effects of free galactose, as with 
      yogurt, fresh or heat-treated suspensions of mechanically disintegrated kefir grains 
      in kefir, containing lactose but no free galactose, were fed to ten Göttingen 
      minipigs. Each meal contained 101.1 (SEM 0.1) mmol lactose in kefir supplemented by 
      either native or heat-treated kefir grains corresponding to a mean 
      beta-galactosidase activity of either 72 (SEM 8) U or zero. Feeding kefir with 
      beta-galactosidase activity resulted in a 30% enhancement of the mean post-prandial 
      plasma galactose peak concentration from 33 (SEM 7) to 43 (SEM 12) mumol/l (n 10), 
      as well as in 23% greater mean areas under the galactose-response curves (8.1 (SEM 
      1.5) v. 6.6 (SEM 1.2) mmol/min per l) if compared with kefir with heat-treated 
      grains. Both differences were significant (P less than 0.05; paired Wilcoxon test by 
      ranks). There was no induction of intestinal beta-galactosidase (EC 3.2.1.108) 
      activity or intestinal lactose-hydrolysing bacteria by lactose feeding. These 
      results give direct evidence of an enhanced lactose digestion and absorption in 
      native fermented milk products due to the microbial beta-galactosidase activity.

AB  - 1. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary β-glucan and kefir (a 
      fermented milk product) on growth performance, blood profiles, relative organ weight 
      and meat quality in broilers. 2. A total of 375 day-of-hatch mixed sex ROSS 308 
      broilers (BW of 46 ± 0.1 g) were used in a 5-week experiment and randomly allotted 
      to one of the following dietary treatments: (1) NC, basal diet; (2) PC, basal diet + 
      40 mg/kg of avilamycin; (3) B, NC + 0.1% β-glucan; (4) K, NC + 0.1% kefir; (5) BK, 
      NC + 0.1% β-glucan + 0.1% kefir. 3. During weeks 0-3, broilers in B, K and BK 
      treatments had higher body weight gain (BWG) than those in NC treatment. During 
      weeks 4-5, BK treatment had a higher BWG than NC treatment. Overall, broilers given 
      PC, K and BK diets had higher BWG than those given NC diet. The feed efficiency 
      ratio (FCR) was improved by PC treatment. 4. Relative liver weight was increased by 
      B treatment, whereas the relative weight of breast meat and gizzard was higher in BK 
      group than that in NC group. Broilers given PC, B and BK diets had greater breast 
      meat redness value and reduced drip loss at d 5 and d 7. The cooking loss was also 
      reduced by B and BK treatments compared with NC treatment. 5. In conclusion, the 
      results suggested that inclusion of 0.1% β-glucan and 0.1% kefir, either 
      individually or combined, would improve growth performance and benefit meat quality 
      in broiler chickens.

AB  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens M1 is a probiotic strain isolated from Taiwanese kefir 
      grains. The present study evaluated the effects of heat, cold, acid and bile salt 
      adaptations on the stress tolerance of L. kefiranofaciens M1. The regulation of 
      protein expression of L. kefiranofaciens M1 under these adaptation conditions was 
      also investigated. The results showed that adaptation of L. kefiranofaciens M1 to 
      heat, cold, acid and bile salts induced homologous tolerance and cross-protection 
      against heterologous challenge. The extent of induced tolerance varied depending on 
      the type and condition of stress. Proteomic analysis revealed that 27 proteins 
      exhibited differences in expression between non-adapted and stress-adapted 
      L. kefiranofaciens M1 cells. Among these proteins, three proteins involved in 
      carbohydrate metabolism (triosephosphate isomerase, enolase and NAD-dependent 
      glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), two proteins involved in pH homeostasis (ATP 
      synthase subunits AtpA and AtpB), two stress response proteins (chaperones DnaK and 
      GroEL) and one translation-related protein (30S ribosomal protein S2) were 
      up-regulated by three of the four adaptation treatments examined. The increased 
      synthesis of these stress proteins might play a critical protective role in the 
      cellular defense against heat, cold, acid and bile salt stresses.

TI  - Effect of probiotic fermented milk (kefir) on glycemic control and lipid profile in 
      type 2 diabetic patients: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical 
      trial.
PG  - 228-37
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a global health problem in the world. Probiotic food has 
      anti-diabetic property. The aim of this trial was to determine the effect of 
      probiotic fermented milk (kefir) on glucose and lipid profile control in patients 
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This randomized double-blind 
      placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 60 diabetic patients aged 35 to 
      65 years.Patients were randomly and equally (n=30) assigned to consume either 
      probiotic fermented milk (kefir) or conventional fermented milk (dough) for 8 weeks. 
      Probiotic group consumed 600 ml/day probiotic fermented milk containing 
      Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria and control group 
      consumed 600 ml/day conventional fermented milk.Blood samples tested for fasting 
      blood glucose, HbA1C, triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C at the 
      baseline and end of the study. RESULTS: The comparison of fasting blood glucose 
      between two groups after intervention was statistically significant (P=0.01). After 
      intervention, reduced HbA1C compared with the baseline value in probiotic fermented 
      milk group was statistically significant (P=0.001), also the HbA1C level 
      significantly decreased in probiotic group in comparison with control group (P=0.02) 
      adjusting for serum levels of glucose, baseline values of HbA1c and energy intake 
      according to ANCOVA model. Serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol 
      and HDL- cholesterol levels were not shown significant differences between and 
      within the groups after intervention. CONCLUSION: Probiotic fermented milk can be 
      useful as a complementary or adjuvant therapy in the treatment of diabetes.

AB  - The biological and technological characteristics of kefiran as well as its 
      importance in grain integrity led us to analyze the microbial kefir grain consortium 
      with focus on Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. The presence of L. kefiranofaciens in 
      the nine kefir grains studied was demonstrated by denaturing gradient gel 
      electrophoresis. By culture dependent methods applying a methodology focused on the 
      search of this species, 22 isolates with typical morphology were obtained and 
      identified applying a combination of SDS-PAGE of whole cell proteins, (GTG)5-PCR and 
      sequence analysis of the housekeeping gene encoding the α-subunit of bacterial 
      phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase (pheS). This polyphasic approach allowed the reliable 
      identification of 11 L. kefiranofaciens, 5 Lactobacillus paracasei, 4 Lactobacillus 
      kefiri and 2 Lactobacillus parakefiri isolates. Isolated L. kefiranofaciens strains 
      produced polysaccharide in strain-dependent concentrations and EPS produced by them 
      also differed in the degree of polymerization. The isolation and accurate 
      identification of L. kefiranofaciens is relevant taking into account the important 
      role of this microorganism in the grain ecosystem as well as its potential 
      application as starter in food fermentations.

AB  - The effects of oral administration of milk and soy milk kefirs on tumor growth in 
      tumor-bearing mice and the mucosal immunoglobulin A response in mice were studied. 
      Oral administration of milk and soy milk kefirs to mice inoculated with sarcoma 180 
      tumor cells resulted in 64.8% and 70.9% inhibition of tumor growth, respectively, 
      compared with controls. In addition, oral administration of the two kefir types 
      induced apoptotic tumor cell lysis. Total immunoglobulin A levels for tissue 
      extracts from the wall of the small intestine were also significantly higher for 
      mice fed a milk kefir or a soy milk kefir regimen for 30 days. These results suggest 
      that milk and soy milk kefirs may be considered among the more promising food 
      components in terms of cancer prevention and enhancement of mucosal resistance to 
      gastrointestinal infection.

AB  - A potential probiotic strain, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens M1, was previously 
      isolated from kefir grains, which are used to manufacture the traditional fermented 
      drink kefir. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Lb. 
      kefiranofaciens M1 on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection, using 
      mice and intestinal cell models. BALB/c mice were daily administrated with either 
      phosphate buffered saline or Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 at 2×10(8) cfu/mouse per day 
      intragastrically for 7 d. Intragastric challenges with EHEC (2×10(9) cfu/mouse) were 
      conducted on d 0, 4, and 7 after treatment. Administration of Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 
      was able to prevent EHEC infection-induced symptoms, intestinal damage, renal 
      damage, bacterial translocation, and Shiga toxin penetration. Furthermore, the 
      mucosal EHEC-specific IgA responses were increased after Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 
      administration in the EHEC-infected mouse system. Additionally, in vitro, Lb. 
      kefiranofaciens M1 was shown to have a protective effect on Caco-2 intestinal 
      epithelial cells and Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cell monolayers; the bacteria 
      limited EHEC-induced cell death and reduced the loss of epithelial integrity. These 
      findings support the potential of Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 treatment as an approach to 
      preventing EHEC infection and its effects.

      contaminant.
PG  - 631-6
AB  - AIMS: To compare microbiological safety of yogurt, kefir and different combinations 
      of yogurt and kefir samples by using three foodborne pathogenic strains (Escherichia 
      coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes 4b and Yersinia enterocolitica O3) as 
      indicators. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fresh yogurt and kefir drinks were added to 
      pasteurized milk at a 5% rate either separately or together, and then incubated at 
      different temperatures (43 degrees C for yogurt and 30 degrees C for kefir), 
      depending on appropriate growth temperature of their starter microflora. While 
      traditional yogurt was found to be the least suppressive on the three pathogenic 
      micro-organisms, samples obtained from two subsequent fermentation process (samples 
      fermented at 43 degrees C for 3 h and at 30 degrees C for 21 h) were more 
      suppressive than that of traditional kefir. There was no significant survival 
      difference between E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes 4b in samples tested (P > 
      0.05), but Y. enterocolitica O3 was more susceptible than other two test strains (P 
      < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiological safety of the dairy product fermented at 
      two consecutive periods was superior than that of traditional yogurt or kefir alone. 
      SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These experiments may mimic what happens when 
      yogurt and kefir starter micro-organisms are combined in a milk fermentation process 
      with different time and temperature periods.

AB  - Shalgam juice, hardaliye, boza, ayran (yoghurt drink) and kefir are the most known 
      traditional Turkish fermented non-alcoholic beverages. The first three are obtained 
      from vegetables, fruits and cereals, and the last two ones are made of milk. Shalgam 
      juice, hardaliye and ayran are produced by lactic acid fermentation. Their 
      microbiota is mainly composed of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Lactobacillus 
      plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei in 
      shalgam fermentation and L. paracasei subsp. paracasei and Lactobacillus casei 
      subsp. pseudoplantarum in hardaliye fermentation are predominant. Ayran is 
      traditionally prepared by mixing yoghurt with water and salt. Yoghurt starter 
      cultures are used in industrial ayran production. On the other hand, both alcohol 
      and lactic acid fermentation occur in boza and kefir. Boza is prepared by using a 
      mixture of maize, wheat and rice or their flours and water. Generally previously 
      produced boza or sourdough/yoghurt are used as starter culture which is rich in 
      Lactobacillus spp. and yeasts. Kefir is prepared by inoculation of raw milk with 
      kefir grains which consists of different species of yeasts, LAB, acetic acid 
      bacteria in a protein and polysaccharide matrix. The microbiota of boza and kefir is 
      affected from raw materials, the origin and the production methods. In this review, 
      physicochemical properties, manufacturing technologies, microbiota and shelf life 
      and spoilage of traditional fermented beverages were summarized along with how 
      fermentation conditions could affect rheological properties of end product which are 
      important during processing and storage.

TI  - Development of a novel whey beverage by fermentation with kefir granules. Effect of 
      various treatments.
PG  - 1091-5
AB  - The development of a novel whey-based beverage with acceptable organoleptic 
      properties is reported, where various treatments were studied. Kefir yeast 
      immobilized on delignified cellulosic materials (DCM) or gluten pellets proved to 
      accelerate whey fermentation significantly, with the latter support being not so 
      preferable. Kefir granules seemed to achieve similar fermentation times as DCM. The 
      final pH of the product is suggested to be 4.1 since the profile of the volatile 
      byproducts was higher than other pH values tested. The addition of fructose seemed 
      to be beneficial on the volatile content of the product, although its acceptability 
      as determined by a preference panel was similar to that of the control. Finally, 
      black raisin extract appeared to promote fermentation without any positive effect on 
      the preference of the evaluators.

PG  - 115-118
LID - 10.4315/0362-028X-46.2.115 [doi]
AB  - Yogurt, buttermilk and kefir were made from milk that was naturally contaminated 
      with aflatoxin M(1) (AFM(1)). Yogurt was made from skim milk alone or skim milk 
      supplemented with 4% nonfat dry milk. The AFM(1) content of yogurt, regardless of 
      formulation, appeared to vary during storage, but after 6 weeks at 7°C it was 
      essentially at the same levels as in the initial milk. Buttermilk was made from skim 
      milk and stored up to 2 weeks at 7°C. In the first 3 trials, the AFM(1) content 
      appeared to increase after fermentation. This apparent increase remained through 4 d 
      when these studies were stopped. In the second 3 trials, the apparent increase in 
      AFM(1) did not occur after fermentation. In these trials, AFM(1) in buttermilk 
      behaved as in yogurt; the apparent content was variable during holding, but AFM(1) 
      remained stable through 2 weeks of refrigerated storage. Kefir was made from skim 
      milk subjected to low-heat (64°C for 30 min) or high-heat pasteurization (84°C for 
      30 min). After fermentation, the apparent AFM(1) content of kefir decreased. During 
      storage the AFM(1) content of kefir in 3 of 4 trials appeared to increase slightly, 
      but in no instance did it return to original levels during or at the end of storage 
      at 7°C.

TI  - Identification of dihydromaltol (2,3-dihydro-5-hydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one) in 
      Ryazhenka Kefir and comparative sensory impact assessment of related cycloenolones.
PG  - 9902-8
LID - 10.1021/jf901569f [doi]
AB  - Dihydromaltol (DHM; 2,3-dihydro-5-hydroxy-6-methyl-4H-pyran-4-one) was identified as 
      a novel potent aroma compound in a dairy product, Ryazhenka kefir, using 
      GC-olfactometry-MS. The flavor impact of the structurally related 
      caramelized-smelling compounds DHM, 2,5-dimethyl-4-hydroxy-3(2H)-furanone (DMHF), 
      5-ethyl-4-hydroxy-2-methyl-3(2H)-furanone (EHMF) and maltol was assessed in various 
      dairy samples by applying the odor activity value concept (OAV = concentration/odor 
      threshold) using flavor (retronasal odor) thresholds instead of odor thresholds. 
      Commercial Ryazhenka kefir, original kefir, and kefir-culture inoculated heated 
      milk, as well as UHT milk, evaporated milk, heated cream, and fresh pasteurized 
      cream, were analyzed. In all dairy samples containing DHM, DMHF appeared to dominate 
      over DHM in its flavor impact. Although DHM, the pyranoid isomer of DMHF, has been 
      found in nature, dihydroethylmaltol (DHEM; 
      6-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-5-hydroxy-4H-pyran-4-one), the pyranoid isomer of EHMF (the 
      seven carbon DMHF homologue), has not been found in nature. Therefore, DHM and its 
      novel homologue, DHEM, were synthesized to determine their flavor thresholds and to 
      investigate structure-odor-relationships among cycloenolones. DHEM has a strong 
      caramelized odor. On the basis of flavor thresholds in water, DHM (50-250 microg/kg) 
      by itself was found to be less than half as potent as DMHF but about 40 times more 
      potent than maltol. DHEM (2.5-5 microg/kg of water) by itself was found to be more 
      potent than DHM and close to the odor intensity of EHMF. The novel data provided on 
      DHM and DHEM support understanding of the relationship between chemical structure 
      and flavor intensity within the important aroma compound class, of cycloenolones.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by 
      Lactobacillus plantarum YW11 on the oxidative status and gut microbiota in an aging 
      mouse model induced with d-galactose. The in vitro assay of the antioxidant activity 
      of the EPS showed concentration-dependent (0.25-3.0 mg/mL) activities. At 3.0 mg/mL, 
      the EPS reached the highest scavenging activities with half maximal inhibitory 
      concentration values against hydroxyl radicals at 75.10% and 1.22 mg/mL, superoxide 
      anion at 62.71% and 1.54 mg/mL, 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl at 35.11% and 0.63 
      mg/mL, and the maximal chelating rate on ferrous ion and the half-maximal chelating 
      concentration of the EPS at 41.09% and 1.07 mg/mL, respectively. High doses of EPS 
      (50 mg/kg per day) effectively relieved the oxidative stress in the aging mice with 
      increased levels of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and 
      total antioxidant capacity in mice serum by 21.55, 33.14, 61.09, and 38.18%, 
      respectively, and decreased malondialdehyde level from 11.69 to 5.89 mmol/mL 
      compared with those in the untreated aging mice model. The analysis of 
      pyrosequencing sequence data from the gut microbiota revealed that the EPS could 
      recover the microbiota diversity and phylotypes decreased or eliminated by the 
      d-galactose treatment. The EPS could selectively decrease the abundance of 
      Flexispira (37.5 fold), and increase the abundance of Blautia (36.5 fold) and 
      Butyricicoccus (9.5 fold), which correspondingly decreased the content of nitrogen 
      oxides to 9.87% and increased the content of short-chain fatty acids by 2.23 fold, 
      thereby improving the oxidative and health conditions of the host intestinal tract. 
      Further correlation analysis of core-microbiota variation induced by different 
      treatments showed a strong correlation with oxidative phenotypes [catalase, goodness 
      of prediction (Q(2)) = 0.49; total antioxidant capacity, Q(2) = 0.45; nitrogen 
      oxides, Q(2) = 0.67; short-chain fatty acids, Q(2) = 0.55]. The fermented milk with 
      L. plantarum YW11 containing EPS also showed favorable antioxidant and gut 
      microbiota regulating activities. The present finding provided new insights into the 
      functional mechanism of probiotics bioactivity.

AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to analyse the bacterial microbiota of water kefir 
      using culture-independent methods. METHODS AND RESULTS: We compared four water 
      kefirs of different origins using 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing and ARDRA. The 
      microbiota consisted of different proportions of the genera Lactobacillus (Lact.), 
      Leuconostoc (Leuc.), Acetobacter (Acet.) and Gluconobacter. Surprisingly, varying 
      but consistently high numbers of sequences representing members of the genus 
      Bifidobacterium (Bif.) were found in all kefirs. Whereas part of the bifidobacterial 
      sequences could be assigned to Bifidobacterium psychraerophilum, a majority of 
      sequences identical to each other could not be assigned to any known species. A 
      nearly full-length sequence of the latter exhibited a beyond-species similarity 
      (96.4%) with the sequence from the closest relative species Bif. psychraerophilum. A 
      Bifidobacterium-specific ARDRA analysis reflected the abundance of the novel 
      Bifidobacterium species by revealing its unique MboI restriction profile. Attempts 
      to isolate the bifidobacteria were successful for Bif. psychraerophilum only. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The complexity of the water kefir microbiota has been underestimated in 
      previously studies. The occurrence of bifidobacteria as part of the consortium is 
      novel. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These data give new insights into the 
      understanding of the complexity of food fermentations and underline the need for 
      approaches detecting noncultivable organisms.

TI  - Exopolysaccharides produced by lactic acid bacteria of kefir grains.
PG  - 805-10
AB  - A Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 strain with high exopolysaccharide 
      activity was selected from among 40 strains of lactic acid bacteria, isolated from 
      kefir grains. By associating the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 
      strain with Streptococcus thermophilus T15, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis C15, 
      Lactobacillus helveticus MP12, and Sacharomyces cerevisiae A13, a kefir starter was 
      formed. The associated cultivation of the lactobacteria and yeast had a positive 
      effect on the exopolysaccharide activity of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. 
      bulgaricus HP1. The maximum exopolysaccharide concentration of the starter culture 
      exceeded the one by the Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus HP1 monoculture 
      by approximately 1.7 times, and the time needed to reach the maximum concentration 
      (824.3 mg exopolysacharides/l) was shortened by 6 h. The monomer composition of the 
      exopolysaccharides from the kefir starter culture was represented by glucose and 
      galactose in a 1.0:0.94 ratio, which proves that the polymer synthesized is kefiran.

TI  - Optimization of processing conditions to improve antioxidant activities of apple 
      juice and whey based novel beverage fermented by kefir grains.
PG  - 3422-32
LID - 10.1007/s13197-014-1397-4 [doi]
AB  - A central composite design (CCD) was used to evaluate the effects of fermentation 
      temperature (20-30 ºC) and kefir grains amount (2-8%w/v) on total phenolic content 
      and antioxidant activities of apple juice and whey based novel beverage fermented by 
      kefir grains. The response surface methodology (RSM) showed that the significant 
      second-order polynomial regression equation with high R(2) (>0.86) was successfully 
      fitted for all response as function of independent variable. The overall optimum 
      region was found to be at the combined level of 7.56%w/v kefir grains and 
      temperature of 24.82 ºC with the highest value for total phenolic content (TPC) and 
      antioxidant activities. At this optimum point TPC, 1, 1-Diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl 
      radical scavenging, metal chelating effect, reducing power, inhibition of linoleic 
      acid autoxidation and inhibition of ascorbate autoxidation were 165.02 mgGA/l, 
      0.38 ml/1 ml, 0.757 (absorbance at 700 nm), 46.12 %, 65.33 % and 21 %, respectively. 
      No significant difference (p < 0.05) was found between actual values and predicated 
      values.

AB  - The influence of fermentation temperature, agitation rate, and additions of carbon 
      sources, nitrogen sources, vitamins and minerals on production of kefiran by kefir 
      grains lactic acid bacteria was studied in a series of experiments. The main aim of 
      the work was to increase the exopolysaccharide (EPS) production where customised 
      milk was used as fermentation medium. It was proved that the controlling of 
      culturing conditions and the modifying of fermentation medium conditions (i.e., 
      carbon, nitrogen, mineral sources and vitamins) can dramatically enhance the 
      production of the EPS. The temperature and agitation rate were critical for kefiran 
      production during the 24 h cultivation of grains; our optimised conditions being 
      25°C and 80 rpm, respectively. In addition, when optimising the effects of 
      additional nutrition, it was found that 5% (w/v) lactose, 0.1% (w/v) thiamine, and 
      0.1% (w/v) FeCl3 led to the maximal production of EPS. The results indicate that 
      nutrients can be utilised to improve the production of EPS and that good kefir 
      grains growth does not appear to be a determining factor for a high production yield 
      of EPS.

TI  - Fermented foods: Availability, cost, ingredients, nutritional content and on-pack 
      claims.
LID - 10.1111/jhn.12905 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fermented foods have been consumed for millennia and 
      commercially-produced variants are now available in the food supply. The present 
      study aimed to investigate the availability, cost, ingredients, nutritional content 
      and on-pack claims of commercially-available fermented foods in the UK. METHODS: All 
      products from seven categories of commercially-available fermented foods were 
      systematically identified at eight national supermarket chains in the UK. Data were 
      extracted from manufacturer and retailer websites and were compared between 
      categories using a Kruskal-Wallis test and Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: In total, 
      143 fermented foods were identified, with kombucha (41, 28.7%), kefir drinks (32, 
      22.4%), sauerkraut (22, 15.4%) and kefir yoghurts (21, 14.7%) being most common. The 
      number of products sold at each retailer differed between categories (p = 0.016), 
      and was greatest for kefir drink (median = 7.0, interquartile range [IQR] = 9.0), 
      kombucha (median = 5.5, IQR = 11.5) and kefir yoghurts (median = 5.0, IQR = 8.5). 
      Kombucha (£1.99 per serving) and kefir drinks (£1.26 per serving) were the most 
      expensive fermented foods and sauerkraut (£0.66 per serving) and miso (£0.20 per 
      serving) were the least expensive. Energy, fat, saturated fat, sugar, protein and 
      salt content varied between fermented foods (p < 0.001). Nutrition claims were made 
      on 72 (50.3%) products, the total number of cultures was labelled on 29 (20.3%), 
      specific strains were named on 53 (37.1%) and bacteria-related benefits were 
      promoted on 39 (27.3%) products. CONCLUSIONS: Commercially-produced fermented foods 
      are widely available in the UK but are diverse in their cost, nutritional content, 
      ingredients and use of on-pack claims. Consumers should be aware of these variations 
      given the limited evidence of functional benefits from controlled human trials.

AB  - The microorganisms associated with sugary Brazilian kefir beverage were investigated 
      using a combination of culture-dependent and -independent methods. A total of 289 
      bacteria and 129 yeasts were identified via phenotypic and genotypic methods. Lb. 
      paracasei (23.8%) was the major bacterial isolate identified, followed by 
      Acetobacter lovaniensis (16.31%), Lactobacillus parabuchneri (11.71%), Lactobacillus 
      kefir (10.03%) and Lactococcus lactis (10.03%). Saccharomyces cerevisiae (54.26%) 
      and Kluyveromyces lactis (20.15%) were the most common yeast species isolated. 
      Scanning electron microscopy showed that the microbiota was dominated by 
      lemon-shaped yeast cells growing in close association with Lactobacillus (long and 
      curved). Some lactic acid bacteria detected by sequence analysis of DGGE (denaturing 
      gradient gel electrophoresis) bands were not recovered at any time through 
      fermentation by plating. Conversely, DGGE fingerprints did not reveal bands 
      corresponding to some of the species isolated by culturing methods. The bacteria 
      Acetobacter lovaniensis and the yeast Kazachstania aerobia are described for the 
      first time in sugary kefir. During the 24 h of fermentation, the concentration of 
      lactic acid ranged from 0.2 to 1.80 mg/ml, and that of acetic acid increased from 
      0.08 to 1.12 mg/ml. The production of ethanol was limited, reaching a final mean 
      value of 1.24 mg/ml.

TI  - [Analysis of bacterial diversity of kefir grains by denaturing gradient gel 
      electrophoresis and 16S rDNA sequencing].
PG  - 310-3
AB  - Kefir is an acidic, mildly alcoholic dairy beverage produced by the fermentation of 
      milk with a grain-like starter culture. These grains usually contain a relatively 
      stable and specific balance of microbes that exist in a complex symbiotic 
      relationship. Kefir grains can be considered a probiotic source as it presents 
      anti-bacterial, anti-mycotic, anti-neoplasic and immunomodulatory properties. The 
      microorganisms in Kefir grains are currently identified by traditional methods such 
      as growth on selective media, morphological and biochemical characteristics. 
      However, the microorganisms that isolate by these methods can not revert to Kefir 
      grains which indicate that there are some other bacteria that are not isolate from 
      it. In this study, PCR-based Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis(DGGE) and 
      sequence analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA gene (16S rDNA) clone libraries was used for 
      the rapid and accurate identification of microorganisms from Kefir grains. The PCR 
      primers were designed from conserved nucleotide sequences on region V3 of 16S rDNA 
      with GC rich clamp at the 5'-end. PCR was performed using the primers and genomic 
      DNAs of Kefir grains bacteria. The generated region V3 of 16S rDNA fragments were 
      separated by denaturing gel, and the dominant 16S rDNA bands were cloned, sequenced 
      and subjected to an online similarity search. Research has shown that regions V3 of 
      16S rDNAs have eight evident bands on the DGGE gel. The sequence analysis of these 
      eight bands has indicated that they belong to different four genera, among them 
      three sequences are similar to Sphingobacterium sp. whose similarities with database 
      sequences are over 98%, three sequences are similar to Lactobacillus sp. whose 
      similarities with database sequences are over 96%, the other two sequence are 
      similar to Enterobacter sp., and Acinetobacter sp. whose similarities with database 
      sequences are over 99% respectively. Although the DGGE method may have a lower 
      sensitivity than the ordinary PCR methods, because when universal bacterial PCR 
      primers are used, only the dominant microbiota of an ecosystem will be visualized on 
      a DGGE gel, producing complex banding patterns. However, it could visualize the 
      bacterial qualitative compositions and reveal the major species of the Kefir grains. 
      Among them Sphingobacterium can be found in Kefir grains as the predominant flora 
      which is reported for the first time. PCR-based DGGE and sequence analysis of 16S 
      rDNA proved to be a valuable culture-independent approach for the rapid and specific 
      identification of the microbial species present in microecosystem and probiotic 
      products.

TI  - Effect of carbohydrate substrate on fermentation by kefir yeast supported on 
      delignified cellulosic materials.
PG  - 658-63
AB  - The suitability of delignified cellulosic (DC) material supported kefir yeast to 
      ferment raw materials that contain various single carbohydrates, for the production 
      of potable alcohol and alcoholic drinks, is examined in this investigation. Results 
      are reported of fermentations carried out with sucrose, fructose, and glucose in 
      synthetic media. Repeated batch fermentations at various initial sugar 
      concentrations of sucrose, fructose, and glucose were performed at 30 degrees C in 
      the presence of the aforementioned biocatalyst. The results clearly show feasible 
      yields in the range of 0.38-0.41 g/g, alcohol concentrations of 7.6-8.2% v/v, 
      fermentation time of 90-115 h, and conversion of 92-96%. DC material supported kefir 
      fermented 11-fold more rapidly than free cells and 9-fold more rapidly in comparison 
      to kissiris supported kefir. The main volatile byproducts such as amyl alcohols 
      (mixture of 2-methyl-1-butanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol), ethanal, and ethyl acetate 
      were formed in all sugar fermentation products. The formation of 65-110 ppm of ethyl 
      acetate is as high and even higher than that obtained with traditional wine yeasts. 
      The increase of the initial concentration of sugar in the fermentation media 
      resulted in an increase in contents of volatiles. The fine aroma that was obtained 
      in the product of fructose could be attributed to the high percentage of ethyl 
      acetate on total volatiles. The efficiency of DC material supported kefir was the 
      same for the fermentations of individual sugars or a mixture of fructose, sucrose, 
      and glucose. When whey with raisin extracts was fermented, lower yields were 
      obtained but the aroma of the product was even better.

TI  - Effects of the oral administration of the products derived from milk fermentation by 
      kefir microflora on immune stimulation.
PG  - 472-9
AB  - Nutritional status has a major impact on the immune system. Probiotic effects 
      ascribed to fermented dairy products arise not only from whole microorganisms but 
      also from metabolites (peptides, exopolysaccharides) produced during the 
      fermentation. We recently demonstrated the immunomodulating capacity of kefir in a 
      murine model. We now aimed at studying the immunomodulating capacity in vivo of the 
      products derived from milk fermentation by kefir microflora (PMFKM) on the gut. 
      BALB/c mice received the PMFKM for 2, 5 or 7 consecutive days. IgA+ and IgG+ cells 
      were determined on histological slices of the small and large intestine. IL-4, IL-6, 
      IL-10, IL-12, IFNgamma and TNFalpha were determined in the gut, intestinal fluid and 
      blood serum. IL-6 was also determined in the supernatant of a primary culture of 
      small intestine epithelial cells challenged with PMFKM. PMFKM up-regulated IL-6 
      secretion, necessary for B-cell terminal differentiation to IgA secreting cells in 
      the gut lamina propria. There was an increase in the number of IgA+ cells in the 
      small and large intestine. The increase in the number of IgA+ cells was accompanied 
      by an increase in the number of IL-4+, IL-10+ and IL-6+ cells in the small 
      intestine. Effects of PMFKM in the large intestine were less widely apparent than 
      the ones observed at the small intestine lamina propria. All cytokines that 
      increased in the small intestine lamina propria, also did so in blood serum, 
      reflecting here the immunostimulation achieved in the gut mucosa. We observed that 
      the PMFKM induced a mucosal response and it was able to up and down regulate it for 
      protective immunity, maintaining the intestinal homeostasis, enhancing the IgA 
      production at both the small and large intestine level. The opportunity exists then 
      to manipulate the constituents of the lumen of the intestine through dietary means, 
      thereby enhancing the health status of the host.

PG  - 434-7
AB  - The characteristics of 58 strains of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from kefir were 
      studied. These strains were tested for adherence to human enterocyte-like Caco-2 
      cells, resistance to acidic pH and bile acid, antimicrobial activities against 
      enteropathogenic bacteria and inhibition of Salmonella typhimurium attachment to 
      Caco-2 cells. The best probiotic properties were observed in L. acidophilus CYC 
      10051 and L. kefiranofaciens CYC 10058. L. kefiranofaciens CYC 10058 produced an 
      exopolysaccharide, which revealed that it was closely related to kefiran, a 
      polysaccharide with antitumoral properties. This is the first in vitro study about 
      the antimicrobial characteristics of the Lactobacillus population of kefir.

      tract conditions was evaluated in vitro. The effects of pH values and bile salts on 
      the viability of LAB were investigated. The results demonstrated that pH value 
      showed a significant effect on the viability. The viable counts exhibited a 
      reduction of 1.5 to 2 log cycles in 0.3% to 0.5% bile salts after 4 h. The viability 
      of LAB exposure to sequential simulated gastric and intestinal juices was assessed 
      by response surface model (RSM). RSM indicated that the gastric pH and gastric 
      contact time significantly affected the viability (P < 0.05), while the effect of 
      intestinal contact time was not significant. Moreover, RSM revealed the interactions 
      of pH and gastric contact time, and of pH and intestinal contact time. The LAB 
      cells, temporarily damaged by the low pH of gastric juice (pH < 2), could recover in 
      the intestinal juice; and the longer the intestinal contact time, the higher the 
      viability of LAB. RSM proved to be a useful and accurate method to predict the 
      viability of LAB under certain laboratory conditions by the model validation. This 
      study indicated that LAB from kefir grains exhibited excellent tolerance to 
      sequential simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions, and that kefiran possessed a 
      significant protective effect on LAB in hostile environments.

AB  - This research aimed to evaluate the effects of using either grain or commercial 
      starter culture on the antioxidative capacity of cow and ewe milk kefirs. The 
      antioxidant capacity of kefir samples during fermentation and 21 d of storage was 
      assessed by using 3 assays: 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) 
      (ABTS) radical cation decolorization; 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH(•)) 
      radical scavenging activity assay; and Fe(+3)-reducing power (ferric reducing 
      antioxidant power assay, FRAP). Vitamin E and β-carotene contents were also 
      quantified. All kefir samples exhibited varying values for DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP 
      assays depending on the starter culture and milk type. Vitamin E and β-carotene 
      contents were similar in all kefir samples during storage. The results of this study 
      suggest that milk type (cow or ewe) and culture type (kefir grains or commercial 
      starter) were the significant parameters for the antioxidative activity of kefir.

AB  - A capsular polysaccharide-producing strain KPB-167B isolated from kefir grains was 
      identified as a homofermentative Lactobacillus. The carbohydrate fermentation 
      pattern and DNA base composition of the strain were different from those of other 
      capsular Lactobacillus species previously isolated from kefir grains. The 
      polysaccharide produced by Lactobacillus sp. KPB-167B was found similar to kefiran 
      by 13C-NMR and methylation analysis. Lactobacillus sp. KPB-167B could grow and 
      produce capsular polysaccharide in MRSL medium with better yield than L. 
      kefiranofaciens, which suggested that it is suitable for kefiran production.

AB  - Eugenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside, also referred to as Citrusin C, is a natural glucoside 
      found among others in cloves, basil and cinnamon plants. Eugenol in a form of free 
      aglycone is used in perfumeries, flavourings, essential oils and in medicinal 
      products. Synthetic Citrusin C was incubated with human saliva in several in vitro 
      models together with substrate-specific enzyme and antibiotics (clindamycin, 
      ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin trihydrate and potassium clavulanate). Citrusin C was 
      detected using liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). 
      Citrusin C was completely degraded only when incubated with substrate-specific A. 
      niger glucosidase E.C 3.2.1.21 (control sample) and when incubated with human saliva 
      (tested sample). The addition of antibiotics to the above-described experimental 
      setting, stopped Citrusin C degradation, indicating microbiologic origin of 
      hydrolysis observed. Our results demonstrate that Citrusin C is subjected to 
      complete degradation by salivary/oral cavity microorganisms. Extrapolation of our 
      results allows to state that in the human oral cavity, virtually all β-D-glucosides 
      would follow this type of hydrolysis. Additionally, a new method was developed for 
      an in vivo rapid test of glucosidase activity in the human mouth on the tongue using 
      fluorescein-di-β-D-glucoside as substrate. The results presented in this study serve 
      as a proof of concept for the hypothesis that microbial hydrolysis path of 
      β-D-glucosides begins immediately in the human mouth and releases the aglycone 
      directly into the gastrointestinal tract.

TI  - Fermentation alters the bioaccessible phenolic compounds and increases the 
      alpha-glucosidase inhibitory effects of aronia juice in a dairy matrix following in 
      vitro digestion.
PG  - 2998-3007

AB  - The prevalence of diabetes reached 415 million worldwide in 2015. Polyphenol-rich 
      food intake can benefit the glycemic control for individuals with diabetes. 
      Fermentation may increase the bioavailability of polyphenols, which is generally 
      low. Aronia (Aronia melanocarpa) is a polyphenol-rich berry that is native to North 
      America. Proanthocyanins and anthocyanins are the major phenolic compounds in 
      aronia. In this study, aronia kefir was made by fermenting cow's milk with added 
      aronia juice. The changes in bioaccessible polyphenols of aronia kefir during 
      digestion were assessed using an in vitro model. The impact of fermentation on the 
      potential bioactivity of aronia polyphenols was evaluated. Results showed that the 
      bioaccessible polyphenols in aronia kefir were elevated during digestion and the 
      antioxidant capacity increased (IC50 of DPPH scavenging decreased from 24.07 mg 
      kefir per mL to 8.97 mg kefir per mL). Digested aronia kefir had less bioaccessible 
      anthocyanins (cyanidin-3-galactoside, cyanidin-3-arabinoside and 
      cyanidin-3-xyloside) but similar antioxidant capacity and stronger inhibitory 
      activity on α-glucosidase (IC50: 152.53 mg kefir per mL) compared to the 
      non-fermented control (IC50: 484.93 mg kefir per mL). These results indicate that 
      fermentation may produce metabolites with higher antioxidant capacity and better 
      α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. Utilizing aronia kefir in the diet is a good 
      strategy to help control blood glucose levels without abdominal side effects. 
      Fermentation may be an effective method to increase the bioavailability of dietary 
      polyphenols in food. More studies about the effects of fermentation on 
      polyphenol-rich food are needed to optimize the potential health-promoting 
      properties.

AB  - Nowadays, probiotics have been proposed for substituting antibiotics in animal feed 
      since the European Union banned the latter compounds in 2006 to avoid serious side 
      effects on human health. Therefore, this work aimed to produce a probiotic product 
      for use in animal feed by fed-batch fermentation of whey with a combination of kefir 
      grains, AGK1, and the fermented whole milk used to activate these kefir grains. The 
      probiotic culture obtained was characterized by high levels of biomass (8.03 g/L), 
      total viability (3.6 × 10(8) CFU/mL) and antibacterial activity (28.26 Activity 
      Units/mL). Some probiotic properties of the probiotic culture were investigated in 
      vitro, including its survival at low pH values, under simulated gastrointestinal 
      conditions, after freezing in skim milk at -20 °C, and in the commercial feed during 
      storage at room temperature. The viable cells of lactic and acetic acid bacteria and 
      yeasts exhibited higher tolerance to acidic pH and simulated gastrointestinal 
      conditions when the cells were protected with skim milk and piglet feed, compared 
      with washed cells. The results indicated the feasibility of producing a probiotic 
      product at a low cost with a potential application in animal feed.

AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are microorganisms that benefit animals with allergic 
      diseases and intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. We propose 
      that LAB can prevent cardiomyocytes inflammation and apoptosis in BALB/c mice using 
      an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergy. Thirty-nine male BALB/c mice were divided into 
      five groups: normal control, allergy control and three allergy groups each treated 
      with Kefir I (Kefir I), Kefir II (Kefir II) or GM080 products (GM080). The 
      myocardial architecture and apoptotic molecules in the excised left ventricle from 
      these mice were investigated and post-treatment effects were evaluated. The 
      inflammatory pathway, including toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), 
      phospholate-Jun-N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), JNK1/2 and tumor necrosis factor- alpha 
      (TNF-α) and the mitochondria-dependent apoptosis phospholate-p38 (p-p38), Bcl-2 
      associated agonist of cell death (Bad), Bcl-2 associated X (Bax) and activated 
      caspase 3, were found to be significant- ly increased in the hearts of allergy mice. 
      The expression of phospholate-nuclear factor-κB (p-NFκB), TNF-α, p-p38 and Bad 
      protein products were reduced or retarded in the Kefir I- or II-treated allergy 
      group. The GM080-treated allergy group exhibited significantly lower p-JNK, JNK1/2, 
      phospholate- Ikappa B (p-IκB), Bax and Bad protein products than the Kefir I and 
      Kefir II allergy groups. These results indicate that LAB can reduce inflammation and 
      prevent apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in the heart of OVA-induced allergy mice.

TI  - The effect of kefir on glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide 
      (NO) levels in mice with colonic abnormal crypt formation (ACF) induced by 
      azoxymethane (AOM).
PG  - 15-9
AB  - In this study we investigated the effect of kefir on the levels of glutathione 
      (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO) in the liver, stomach, spleen and 
      colon of mice with colonic aberrant crypts formed by azoxymethane (AOM). Thirty 12 
      weeks old Swiss Albino mice averaging 31.5 g weight were used as experimental 
      animals. The mice were separated into 3 groups. The first group was the control 
      group, second group was the AOM and third group was the AOM+kefir group. We applied 
      AOM to the second and third groups. Mice were fed ad libitum by laboratory rodent 
      chow during the experiment period. Water was given to the first and second groups 
      and third group received only kefir diluted with water (50%). AOM was injected 
      subcutaneously to the second and third groups for 7 weeks (two times a week, 5 
      mg/kg). Six weeks after the final AOM treatment the animals were sacrificed and 
      liver, stomach, spleen and colon samples were collected from all the groups. MDA 
      level demonstrated an increase only in stomach for the third group (p < 0.001), 
      while an elevation was observed for all of the four organs for the second group 
      (spleen p < 0.001, liver p < 0.001, colon p < 0.01). GSH level showed an increase in 
      the second group at stomach (p < 0.01) and colon (p < 0.001), while in the third 
      group, a small increase was determined only at the colon (p < 0.05). NO level 
      increased at all of the organs in the second group (spleen, liver, colon p < 0.001, 
      stomach p < 0.05), but only at liver and colon in the third group 3 (p < 0.001). In 
      conclusion these results showed that kefir plays an antioxidant role.

TI  - Lactose uptake rate measurements by 14C-labelled lactose reveals promotional 
      activity of porous cellulose in whey fermentation by kefir yeast.
PG  - 1973-81
LID - 10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.03.126 [doi]
AB  - Lactose uptake rate by kefir yeast, immobilized on tubular cellulose and gluten 
      pellets during fermentation of lactose and whey, was monitored using (14)C-labelled 
      lactose. Results illustrated that, in all cases, lactose uptake rate was strongly 
      correlated with fermentation rate and the fermentation's kinetic parameters were 
      improved by kefir yeast entrapped in tubular cellulose. As a result, twofold faster 
      fermentations were achieved in comparison with kefir yeast immobilized on gluten. 
      This is probably due to cluster and hydrogen bonds formation between cellulose and 
      inhibitors, such as Ca(++) and generated lactic acid, by which they leave the liquid 
      medium. The findings, regarding the promotional effect of cellulose, seem promising 
      for application in industrial whey fermentations.

AB  - Efficient reconstitution followed by fermentation of nonfat (skimmed) dry milk is 
      one of the most important aspects in manufacturing of various dairy products. As a 
      first stage, dry milk is normally being reconstituted using conventional approaches 
      such as heating and stirring the mixture. Nevertheless, we demonstrated, that 
      low-frequency (22 ± 1.65 kHz) ultrasound can be used as an alternative to the 
      traditional methods of milk recovery. Low-frequency ultrasound was applied during 
      pre-fermentation stage to improve the dispersity of the resulting milk product and 
      to create good conditions for a post-ultrasound bacterial fermentation of milk. The 
      applied ultrasound power was set in the range of 60-120 W/L. For the fermentation 
      process we used: kefir fungi, fermenter of direct inoculation for yogurt LYOBAC YOYO 
      and mixed culture for kefir LAT LC K. The effectiveness of ultrasound treatment was 
      evaluated based on the accumulation of exopolysaccharides (EPS), vitamin C content, 
      as well as antioxidant activity of the resulting milk product. The effect of 
      ultrasound on microflora and the role of the specific types of bacteria such as 
      Lactobacillus on the accumulation of biologically active compounds in the fermented 
      milk products was studied with use of electron microscopy and MALDI - to FMS method. 
      Overall, our results showed that reconstitution of dry milk with use of ultrasound 
      improves further accumulation of biologically active compounds and rises the 
      nutritional quality of the fermented product.

AB  - A course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) was designed to integrate 
      key microbiological principles and techniques into an authentic research experience 
      in a classroom setting and was implemented in an undergraduate microbiology 
      laboratory course. Students conducted a 6-week study in order to determine the 
      identity and quantity of unique probiotic species from various types of kefir. This 
      course module followed an inquiry-based pedagogical approach in which students use 
      the scientific process to investigate an unknown question with no predetermined 
      outcome. During each lab, relevant microbiological topics and laboratory concepts 
      were presented. Students then performed various laboratory techniques, reinforcing 
      the lecture material with hands-on experience. In addition, students participated in 
      reflection through group presentation of their results, bioinformatic analysis and 
      literature review. Based on data collected from pre- and post-study survey 
      responses, both student knowledge and attitudes towards the topics covered improved 
      due to participation in this CURE. Importantly, this CURE can be implemented at many 
      levels of education, requiring only minimal resources and common laboratory 
      equipment.

AB  - In an attempt to seek for suitable dried cultures, thermally-dried kefir was 
      employed as starter in hard-type cheese production and tested in cheeses ripened at 
      5, 18 and 22 degrees C. Both free and immobilised on casein kefir cells were used 
      and compared to cheese made without starter culture. Cheese products made with free 
      cells of kefir culture were characterized by longer preservation time, improved 
      aroma, taste, texture characteristics and increased degree of openness. Volatile 
      profiles obtained by GC/MS analysis revealed a 216% increase in total concentration 
      of esters, organic acids, alcohols and carbonyl compounds between cheeses prepared 
      with and without kefir culture.

AB  - Turbidity in beverages is typically achieved by addition of emulsion based cloud 
      systems. Their intrinsic instability necessitates the widespread use of 
      technological measures and use of food additives to prevent emulsion decay. In this 
      work, we explored the possibility to establish a new generation of natural, stable 
      clouding systems based on bacterial dextrans. Lactobacillus hordei TMW 1.1907 
      originating from water kefir was used to produce dextrans in sucrose supplemented 
      apple or grape juices. By varying the fermentation conditions, two distinct types of 
      dextran molecules could be produced at yields ranging from 2.5 to 8.5 g/L. The 
      dextran-containing fermentates showed an unchanged turbidity after pasteurization at 
      acidic pH and subsequent storage for three months. No sedimentation of particles 
      occurred upon storage. Neutralization of the acidic fruit juices to pH 7 prior to 
      fermentation significantly increased the dextran yields. The molecular weight, rms 
      radii and turbidity of dextrans produced at 20 °C were higher than those produced at 
      30 °C. Characterization of the isolated dextrans by asymmetric flow field-flow 
      fractionation coupled to multi-angle laser light scattering revealed a random-coil 
      like structure and rms radii ranging from 66.0 to 87.4 nm. The averaged molar masses 
      of the cloud forming dextrans were in the approximate range of 103.1 to 141.6 MDa. 
      In conclusion, our results demonstrate the possibility to ferment fruit juices for 
      in situ production of dextrans exhibiting novel techno-functional properties beyond 
      gelling and thickening.

AB  - Water kefir granules are supposed to mainly consist of dextrans produced by 
      Lactobacillus (L.) hilgardii. Still, other microorganisms such as L. hordei, L. 
      nagelii, Leuconostoc (Lc.) citreum and Saccharomyces (S.) cerevisiae are commonly 
      isolated from water kefir granules, while their contribution to the granule 
      formation remains unknown. We studied putative functions of these microbes in 
      granule formation, upon development of a simplified model system containing 
      hydrophilic object slides, which mimics the hydrophilic surface of a growing kefir 
      granule. We found that all tested lactic acid bacteria produced glucans, while 
      solely those isolated from the four different L. hordei strains induced yeast 
      aggregation on the hydrophilic slides. Therefore, structural differences between 
      these glucans were investigated with respect to their size distributions and their 
      linkage types. Beyond the finding that all glucans were identified as dextrans, 
      those of the four L. hordei strains were highly similar among each other regarding 
      portions of linkage types and size distributions. Thus, our study suggests the 
      specific size and structural organization of the dextran produced by L. hordei as 
      the main cause for inducing S. cerevisiae aggregation and network formation on 
      hydrophilic surfaces and thus as crucial initiation of the stepwise water kefir 
      granule growth.

AB  - Due to the increased interest shown in kefir, the present study examined its effects 
      on some developmental characteristics in Drosophila. To compare the results related 
      to kefir, another fermented product, i.e., yogurt, and the raw material of kefir, 
      i.e., milk, were included in the experiment. All three foods were fed to Drosophila 
      by addition to the medium. The results showed that the three foods delayed 
      development in generations F1 and F2. In both generations, the number of adults was 
      lower than that of the control group, but the comparison of the foods among 
      themselves showed no significant difference. Moreover, the negative effect continued 
      in generation F2. Phenotypically abnormal individuals were observed in the 
      experiments, but there was no significant difference. Furthermore, the sex ratio 
      changed in all the groups, including the control group. In the experimental group 
      fed kefir, the sex ratio changed in favor of females, whereas in the other groups, 
      it changed in favor of males. Whether the milk and milk products were fermented did 
      not change the effect on Drosophila, but unexpectedly it delayed development, 
      reduced the number of adults, and changed the sex ratio. It can be concluded that 
      the three foods delayed development and altered the sex ratio in Drosophila.

TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria within the consortium of a kefir grain by 
      sequencing 16S rDNA variable regions.
PG  - 1111-7
AB  - The microflora of a kefir grain was identified using a polymerase chain 
      reaction-based strategy combined with 16S rRNA gene sequencing. DNA was extracted 
      from the kefir grain and amplified in its 16S rDNA V1 and V2 regions. To guarantee a 
      good representation of the overall lactic acid bacteria populations, DNA 
      amplification was performed separately with primers specific either to the dominant 
      or to the less abundant bacterial groups. The amplified fragments were cloned in 
      Escherichia coli and then sequenced. Sequences of the V1 region were gathered into 5 
      groups of similarity and identified by aligning with the sequences of a public 
      library. The V1 region allowed the identification of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, 
      L. kefir, L. parakefir, and Lactococcus lactis but was inappropriate for the 
      identification of leuconostocs at species level. Among 16S rDNA variable regions, 
      the V2 region showed the highest variability between Leuconostoc species. 
      Nevertheless, even in the V2 region, differences were too tenuous for effective 
      identification of L. mesenteroides. The methodology described here allowed detection 
      of the dominant species within each targeted microbial group.

TI  - Development of a method based on chemometric analysis of Raman spectra for the 
      discrimination of heterofermentative lactobacilli.
PG  - 233-41
LID - 10.1017/S0022029911000124 [doi]
AB  - In this work, a method based on Raman spectroscopy in combination with Principal 
      Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) has 
      been developed for the rapid differentiation of heterofermentative related 
      lactobacilli. In a first approach, Lactobacillus kefir strains were discriminated 
      from other species of heterofermentative lactobacilli: Lb. parakefir and Lb. brevis. 
      After this first approach, PCA allowed for a clear differentiation between Lb. 
      parakefir and Lb.brevis. For the first level of discrimination, PCA was performed on 
      the whole spectra and also on delimited regions, defined taking into consideration 
      the loading values. The best regions allowing a clear differentiation between Lb. 
      kefir and non-Lb. kefir strains were found to be: the 1700-1500 cm(-1), 1500-1185 
      cm(-1) and 1800-400 (whole spectrum) cm(-1) Raman ranges. In order to develop a 
      classification rule, PLS-DA was carried out on the mentioned regions. This method 
      permitted the discrimination and classification of the strains under study in two 
      groups: Lb. kefir and non-Lb. kefir. The model was further validated using 
      lactobacilli strains from different culture collections or strains isolated from 
      kefir grains previously identified using molecular methods. The second approach 
      based on PCA was also performed on the whole spectra and on delimited regions, being 
      the regions 1700-1500 cm(-1), 1500-1185 cm(-1) and 1185-1020 cm(-1), i.e., those 
      allowing the clearest discrimination between Lb. parakefir and Lb. brevis. The 
      results obtained in this work, allowed a clear discrimination within 
      heterofermentative lactobacilli strains, proteins being the biological structures 
      most determinant for this discrimination.

      products and the local application. METHODS: This study included 3 groups with 15 
      orthodontic patients in each. The control group included patients who had no 
      probiotic treatment, the subjects in the kefir group consumed 2 × 100 ml of kefir 
      (Atatürk Orman Ciftligi, Ankara, Turkey) per day, and the subjects in the toothpaste 
      group brushed their teeth with toothpaste with probiotic content (GD toothpaste; 
      Dental Asia Manufacturing, Shah Alam, Selangor, Malaysia) twice a day. Samples were 
      collected at 3 times: beginning of the study, 3 weeks later, and 6 weeks later. The 
      salivary flow rate, buffer capacity, and Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus 
      levels in the saliva were evaluated. Chair-side kits were used to determine the S 
      mutans and Lactobacillus levels. RESULTS: A statistically significant decrease was 
      observed in the salivary S mutans and Lactobacillus levels in the kefir and 
      toothpaste groups compared with the control group (P <0.05). A statistically 
      significant increase was observed in the toothpaste group compared with the control 
      and kefir groups in buffer capacity. Changes in the salivary flow rate were not 
      statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The regular use of probiotics during fixed 
      orthodontic treatment reduces the S mutans and Lactobacillus levels in the saliva.

AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum MA2 was isolated from Chinese traditional Tibetan kefir 
      grains. The antioxidant activities in vitro of this strain were evaluated 
      extensively. The results showed that L. plantarum MA2 can tolerate hydrogen peroxide 
      up to 2.0mM, and its fermentate (fermented supernatant, intact cell and cell-free 
      extract) had strong reducing capacities, lipid peroxidation inhibition capacities, 
      Fe(2+)-chelating abilities, as well as various free radical scavenging capacities. 
      Additionally, both the fermented supernatant and cell homogenate exhibited 
      glutathione peroxidase activity and superoxide dismutase activity. In order to 
      investigate the antioxidant mechanism of L. plantarum MA2 at the molecular level, 
      eight antioxidant-related genes were identified, and further analyzed. Three groups 
      of genes cat, gshR and npx, were found up-regulated under H(2)O(2) challenge.

TI  - Interventions for the management of abdominal pain in ulcerative colitis.
PG  - CD013589

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammation of the colon 
      characterised by periods of relapse and remission. It starts in the rectum and can 
      extend throughout the colon. UC and Crohn's disease (CD) are the most common 
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs). However, UC tends to be more common than CD. It 
      has no known cure but can be managed with medication and surgery. However, studies 
      have shown that abdominal pain persists in up to one-third of people with UC in 
      remission. Abdominal pain could be a symptom of relapse of the disease due to 
      adverse effects of medication, surgical complications and strictures or adhesions 
      secondary to UC. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions for 
      managing abdominal pain in people with ulcerative colitis. SEARCH METHODS: We 
      searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and five other databases and clinical trials registries on 
      28 April 2021. We contacted authors of relevant studies and ongoing or unpublished 
      trials that may be relevant to the review. We also searched references of trials and 
      systematic reviews for any additional trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: All published, 
      unpublished and ongoing randomised trials that compared interventions for the 
      management of abdominal pain with other active interventions or standard therapy, 
      placebo or no therapy were included. People with both active and inactive disease 
      were included. We excluded studies that did not report on any abdominal pain 
      outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently conducted 
      data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessments. We analysed data using Review 
      Manager 5. We expressed dichotomous and continuous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs) and 
      mean differences (MDs), respectively, with 95% confidence intervals. We assessed the 
      certainty of the evidence using the GRADE methodology. MAIN RESULTS: We included 
      five studies (360 randomised participants). Studies considered mainly participants 
      in an inactive state of the disease.   No conclusions could be drawn about the 
      efficacy of any of the interventions on pain frequency, pain intensity, and 
      treatment success. The certainty of the evidence was very low for all comparisons 
      because of imprecision due to sparse data, and risk of bias. One study compared a 
      low FODMAPs diet (n=13) to a sham diet (n=13). The evidence is very uncertain about 
      the effect of this treatment on pain frequency (MD -4.00, 95% CI -20.61 to 12.61) 
      and intensity (MD -9.00, 95% CI -20.07 to 2.07). Treatment success was not reported. 
      One study compared relaxation training (n=20) to wait-list (n=20). The evidence is 
      very uncertain about the effect of this treatment on pain frequency at end of 
      intervention (MD 2.60, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.06) and 6-month follow-up (MD 3.30, 95% CI 
      1.64 to 4.96). Similarly, the evidence is very uncertain about the effect of this 
      treatment on pain intensity at end of intervention (MD -1.70, 95% CI -2.92 to -0.48) 
      and 6-month follow-up (MD -2.30, 95% CI -3.70 to -0.90). Treatment success was not 
      reported. One study compared yoga (n=30) to no intervention (n=30). The study 
      defined treatment success as the presence or absence of pain; however, the data they 
      provided was unclear. Pain frequency and intensity were not reported. One study 
      compared a kefir diet (Lactobacillus bacteria, n=15) to no intervention (n=15). The 
      evidence is very uncertain about the effect of this treatment on pain intensity (MD 
      -0.17, 95% CI -0.91 to 0.57). Pain frequency and treatment success were not 
      reported. One study compared a stellate ganglion block treatment (n=90) to 
      sulfasalazine treatment (n=30). The study defined treatment success as 
      "stomachache"; however, the data they provided was unclear. Pain frequency and 
      intensity were not reported. Two studies reported withdrawals due to adverse events. 
      One study reported withdrawals due to adverse events as zero. Two studies did not 
      report this outcome.  We cannot draw any conclusions about the effects of any of the 
      interventions on withdrawals due to adverse events because of the very limited 
      evidence. The reporting of secondary outcomes was inconsistent. Adverse events 
      tended to be very low or zero. However, we can make no clear judgements about 
      adverse events for any of the interventions, due to the low number of events. 
      Anxiety was measured and reported at end of intervention in only one study (yoga 
      versus no intervention), and depression was not measured in any of the studies. We 
      can therefore draw no meaningful conclusions about these outcomes. AUTHORS' 
      CONCLUSIONS: We found very low-certainty evidence on the efficacy and safety of 
      interventions for the management of abdominal pain in ulcerative colitis. Pervasive 
      issues with very serious imprecision from small samples size and high risk of bias 
      have led to very low-certainty outcomes, precluding conclusions. While few adverse 
      events and no serious adverse events were reported, the certainty of these findings 
      was again very low for all comparisons, so no conclusions can be drawn. There is a 
      need for further research. We have identified eight ongoing studies in this review, 
      so an update will be warranted. It is key that future research addresses the issues 
      leading to reduced certainty of outcomes, specifically sample size and reporting 
      that leads to high risk of bias. It is also important that if researchers are 
      considering pain as a critical outcome, they should report clearly if participants 
      were pain-free at baseline; in that case, data would be best presented as separate 
      subgroups throughout their research.

AB  - Water kefir is a fermented beverage, which is traditionally prepared from sucrose, 
      kefir grains, dried or fresh fruits, and water. L. hordei and S. cerevisiae are 
      isolated as predominant and stable species of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts, 
      respectively. In this study we demonstrate that label free quantitative proteomics 
      is useful to study microbial interaction along the response of co-cultivated L. 
      hordei TMW 1.1822 in the presence of S. cerevisiae TMW 3.221 as compared with their 
      single cultures in a water kefir model. It is shown and L. hordei responds to S. 
      cerevisiae in many respects revealing a mutualistic relationship. The data suggest 
      that L. hordei responds to the presence of S. cerevisiae with adjustment of 
      intracellular redox reactions controlled of proteins, which are part of Rex regulons 
      and proteins involved in the glycolytic pathway and energy fermentation. An NADH, 
      H(+)-driven metabolic switch to preferential production of butanediol instead of 
      acetate or lactate, and up-regulation of arginine deiminase, alleviated acid stress 
      and concomitantly protected S. cerevisiae against an acidic environment, which L. 
      hordei generated in single culture. Moreover, the data suggest that the presence of 
      S. cerevisiae in the nitrogen and fatty acids limited environment of the water kefir 
      facilitated and improved the growth of L. hordei by delivering gluconate, fructose, 
      amino acids, fatty acids or substrates for their biosynthesis. Up-regulation of the 
      OppABCDF peptide transport and enzymes involved in amino acid metabolism indicates 
      enhanced peptide uptake, as well as cross-feeding of L. hordei by glutamine, 
      glutamate, histidine, tryptophan, methionine, proline, tryptophan delivered by S. 
      cerevisiae.

      legal proceeding. The questioned recipe consisted of 21 water, 6 soup-spoons of 
      kefir granules (about 120 g), 150 g sugar, 2 figs and one lemon. The consumption 
      took place after two days of fermentation. Experimentally we found, that one liter 
      of this kefir product may contain up to 38 g/l ethanol after 7 to 10 days. On the 
      second day we measured up to 16 g/l ethanol. Our results may be import for expert 
      appraisements concerning unability of driving.

TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Six International Artisanal Kefirs Against Bacillus 
      cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, and 
      Staphylococcus aureus.

AB  - Kefir, a fermented dairy beverage, exhibits antimicrobial activity due to many 
      metabolic products, including bacteriocins, generated by lactic acid bacteria. In 
      this study, the antimicrobial activities of artisanal kefir products from Fusion Tea 
      (A), Britain (B), Ireland (I), Lithuania (L), the Caucuses region (C), and South 
      Korea (K) were investigated against select foodborne pathogens. Listeria 
      monocytogenes CWD 1198, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis ATCC 13076, 
      Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, and Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 were inhibited by 
      artisanal kefirs made with kefir grains from diverse origins. Kefirs A, B, and I 
      inhibited all bacterial indicator strains examined at varying levels, except 
      Escherichia coli ATCC 12435 (non-pathogenic, negative control). Kefirs K, L, and C 
      inhibited all indicator strains, except S. aureus ATCC 25923 and E. coli ATCC 12435. 
      Bacteriocins present in artisanal kefirs were determined to be the main 
      antimicrobials in all kefirs examined. Kefir-based antimicrobials are being proposed 
      as promising natural biopreservatives as per the results of the study.

TI  - Effect of Addition of Pectins from Jujubes (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) on Vitamin C 
      Production during Heterolactic Fermentation.
LID - 10.3390/molecules25112706 [doi]

AB  - Soluble fibers, including pectins from apple and lemon, are commonly used as 
      prebiotic and to prepare functional foods. The present study aimed to investigate 
      the physicochemical and functional properties of pectins extracted from jujubes 
      (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.). Pectins were extracted from jujubes at three stages of 
      harvesting and characterized by FTIR and SEM analyses. Whole milk inoculated with 
      kefir grains was supplemented by 0.25 mg·mL(-1) of pectins. The pH value and vitamin 
      C content were evaluated after 24 and 48 h of fermentation. Pectins from jujubes at 
      the first harvesting stage (PJ1K) showed the lowest methoxylation degree. The 
      addition of pectins enhanced the production of vitamin C during heterolactic 
      process. This result was found to depend on jujube harvesting stage as PJ1K 
      stimulated the growth of yeasts in kefir grains yielding to the highest amount of 
      vitamin C (0.83 ± 0.01 µg·mL(-1)) compared to other samples (0.53-0.60 µg·mL(-1)) at 
      24 h. Lactic acid bacteria diminish pH rapidly with respect to control (4.13 ± 
      0.05), according to the stage of maturation, reducing its initial value by 38.3% in 
      PJ1K. Besides being an excellent prebiotic, pectins from jujubes could be used to 
      enrich kefir with vitamin C.

AB  - This study aimed to develop an analytical method for the determination of tryptophan 
      and its derivatives in kynurenine pathway using tandem mass spectrometry in various 
      fermented food products (bread, beer, red wine, white cheese, yoghurt, kefir and 
      cocoa powder). The method entails an aqueous extraction and reversed phase 
      chromatographic separation using pentafluorophenyl (PFP) column. It allowed 
      quantitation of low ppb levels of tryptophan and its derivatives in different 
      fermented food matrices. It was found that beer samples were found to contain 
      kynurenine within the range of 28.7±0.7μg/L and 86.3±0.5μg/L. Moreover, dairy 
      products (yoghurt, white cheese and kefir) contained kynurenine ranging from 30.3 to 
      763.8μg/kg d.w. Though bread samples analyzed did not contain kynurenic acid, beer 
      and red wine samples as yeast-fermented foods were found to contain kynurenic acid. 
      Among foods analyzed, cacao powder had the highest amounts of kynurenic acid 
      (4486.2±165.6μg/kgd.w), which is a neuroprotective compound.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to evaluate the conservation of blackberry, cv. Tupy, 
      stored under refrigeration and coated with different edible coatings. Four 
      treatments were carried out: control T1 (uncoated), T2 (chitosan 1.5 %), T3 (cassava 
      starch 2.5 %) and T4 (kefir grains in water 20 %), stored at temperatures of 0 and 
      10 °C; 1.0 % (m/v) sorbitol/glycerol was added as plasticizers. Chemical and 
      physical-chemical evaluations (weight loss, firmness, pH, titratable acidity, 
      soluble solids, SS/TA ratio and anthocyanins) were made, besides rot incidence. The 
      results showed that cooling to 0 °C combined with T2 showed an effect in reducing 
      the physiological loss of weight (4.41 %), in retaining fruit firmness (19.1 N) and 
      presenting lower incidence of rot (6.19 %). Likewise, in physical and chemical 
      parameters: SS did not alter significantly during the whole period of 18 days of 
      storage.

AB  - This study examined the effect of kefir, yogurt, and milk on egg production and 
      development in Drosophila melanogaster Meigen. Kefir, yogurt, and milk were added to 
      the Drosophila culture medium. First they were fed to mature individuals and then 
      these females laid eggs on medium containing kefir, yogurt, and milk. Later the 
      development of eggs and larvae was examined. The experiments were conducted on two 
      generations, the F1 generation reared with additives in the media and F2 without the 
      additives. The effects of these substances on the basic stages of development were 
      also examined. In the experimental groups, the numbers of eggs and larvae decreased 
      considerably in both the F1 and F2 generations. The comparison between the 
      experimental groups themselves also showed a difference. In both generations, 
      development of eggs into third instar larvae was reduced and metamorphosis was 
      delayed. In addition, morphological abnormalities were observed in the larvae. 
      Overall the results showed that kefir, yogurt, and milk affected egg and larva 
      development negatively and this negative effect continued in the F2 generation. The 
      continuation of this negative effect in the F2 generation, which was not exposed to 
      various milk additives, is an interesting finding. These results indicate that the 
      nutrients from the milk and the milk products used were neither utilized by nor 
      beneficial for this insect.

TI  - Fermented whey as poultry feed additive to prevent fungal contamination.
PG  - 3189-94
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.6669 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fungal contamination of poultry feed causes economic losses to industry 
      and represents a potential risk to animal health. The aim of the present study was 
      to analyze the effectiveness of whey fermented with kefir grains as additive to 
      reduce fungal incidence, thus improving feed safety. RESULTS: Whey fermented for 24 
      h at 20 °C with kefir grains (100 g L(-1) ) reduced conidial germination of 
      Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus terreus, Aspergillus 
      fumigatus, Penicillium crustosum, Trichoderma longibrachiatum and Rhizopus sp. 
      Poultry feed supplemented with fermented whey (1 L kg(-1) ) was two to four times 
      more resistant to fungal contamination than control feed depending on the fungal 
      species. Additionally, it contained kefir microorganisms at levels of 1 × 10(8) 
      colony-forming units (CFU) kg(-1) of lactic acid bacteria and 6 × 10(7) CFU kg(-1) 
      of yeasts even after 30 days of storage. CONCLUSION: Fermented whey added to poultry 
      feed acted as a biopreservative, improving its resistance to fungal contamination 
      and increasing its shelf life.

AB  - In the current study the microbiological, sensory and chemical properties of 24 
      kefirs (12 producers) from Estonian, Latvian and Lithuanian retail market were 
      determined using gas chromatography (GC), high performance liquid chromatography 
      (HPLC-MS/MS-Q-TOF and LC-ion trap MS/MS), spectrophotometry and other methods. 
      Antihypertensive, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibiting, antioxidant and 
      antibacterial peptides were found in the kefir samples. According to the results of 
      principal component analysis of 200 most abundant compounds obtained with 
      HPLC-MS/MS-Q-TOF analysis, Estonian kefirs differed from the rest. Kefirs of Latvian 
      and Lithuanian origin showed similarities in several characteristics, probably 
      related to the starter cultures and technological processes. The fatty acids 
      composition of all Baltic kefirs was uniform. The antioxidant capacity of the kefirs 
      varied slightly, whereas intermediate positive correlation (r = 0.32, P < 0.05) was 
      found between antioxidativity and total bacterial count. The lipid oxidation level, 
      estimated as the content of linoleic and oleic acid primary oxidation products, 
      oxylipins, was very low in all studied kefirs. Only one third of analysed kefirs met 
      the requirements of the minimum sum of viable microorganisms, indicated in the Codex 
      Standard for Fermented Milks.

TI  - Effect of addition of wild garlic (Allium ursinum) on the quality of kefirs from 
      sheep's milk.
PG  - 209-215
LID - 10.17306/J.AFS.0476 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sheep&rsquo;s milk has a high content of total solids, which qualifies 
      it as a very good raw material for the production of fermented milk drinks. 
      Currently, there are commercially produced kefirs and yogurts from sheep&rsquo;s 
      milk in the countries of the Mediterranean region. The growing interest in the 
      consumption of these products is justified not only by their taste merits, but also 
      because of their health-promoting proper- ties. The aim of the present study was to 
      determine the effect of the addition of 1% of lyophilized wild garlic powder on the 
      properties of kefirs from sheep&rsquo;s milk. METHODS: Sheep&rsquo;s milk was 
      pasteurized (85&deg;C, 30 min), cooled down, enriched with 1% of freeze-dried wild 
      garlic powder, inoculated with a Commercial VITAL kefir culture and fermented for 16 
      hours (26&deg;C). The influence of wild garlic on acidity (pH, &deg;SH), syneresis 
      (%), texture (TPA test), colour (L*a*b*) and the sensory profile of kefirs was 
      conducted. RESULTS: Wild garlic could be used as a taste and flavour modifier in the 
      production of kefir from sheep&rsquo;s milk. The addition of 1% of freeze-dried wild 
      garlic slowed down the fermentation of kefir, changed colour and reduced syneresis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Wild garlic could be used as a valuable supplement and a modifier of 
      taste and flavour in kefir from sheep&rsquo;s milk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The hyperglycemia leads to increased oxidative stress, causing lipid 
      peroxidation and imbalance in the immune system. AIMS: To investigate the effect of 
      Kefir - a probiotic containing different strains - on metabolic parameters, 
      cytokines, nitric oxide (NO) production, phagocytic activity of peritoneal 
      macrophages and intestinal modulation in diabetes. METHODS: Wistar rats received 
      injection of streptozotocin (45 mg/kg, intravenously) and diabetes was defined as 
      glycemia ≥200 mg/dL. The animals were distributed in four groups: control (CTL); 
      control Kefir (CTLK); diabetic (DM); diabetic Kefir (DMK). Kefir was given at 
      1.8 mL/day by gavage, started on the 5th day of diabetes, during 8 weeks. The 
      animals were allocated in metabolic cages, pre and post treatment with Kefir, for 
      measurement of the metabolic parameters, such as water intake, food intake, 
      diuresis, glycemia, body mass, insulin and lipid profile, these last two were only 
      measured at the end of Kefir protocol. After treatment, the animals were euthanized 
      and the peritoneal cavity was prepared, resident macrophages were collected and 
      cultured for analysis of the phagocytic activity, cytokines (IL-10, TNF-α, IL-17, 
      IL-1β) and NO. The intestinal modulation was performed by the quantification of 
      Peyer's patches (PP) in the small intestine. The data were presented as mean ± SEM, 
      with significance of p < 0.05. RESULTS: DM when compared to CTL showed increase in 
      water intake (133 ± 7 vs. 28 ± 1 mL, p < 0.0001), food intake (40 ± 2 vs. 16 ± 1 g, 
      p < 0.0001), diuresis (102 ± 5 vs. 13 ± 1 mL, p < 0.0001) and glycemia (567 ± 12 vs. 
      84 ± 3 mg/dL, p < 0.0001), while in DMK group all these metabolic parameters were 
      decreased (96 ± 14; 36 ± 1; 86 ± 7 and 407 ± 19, respectively, p < 0.0001), 
      presenting increase of body mass (42 ± 5 vs. 16 ± 4Δ, p < 0.0001) and insulin levels 
      (0.3 ± 0.8 vs. 0.1 ± 0.04 ng/mL, p < 0.0001) compared to DM. The lipid profile of 
      the diabetic groups showed tendency to increase compared to the respective controls. 
      In relation to function of peritoneal macrophages, DMK group vs. DM showed 
      improvement in phagocytic capacity (70 ± 5 vs. 51 ± 7%, p = 0,0023) and increased 
      concentration of all the cytokines analyzed (pg/mL), as IL-10 (926 ± 69 vs. 
      556 ± 92, p = 0.0004), TNF-α (178 ± 20 vs. 109 ± 20, p = 0.005), IL-17 (33 ± 1 vs. 
      9 ± 1, p = 0.0001) and IL-1β (102 ± 14 vs. 70 ± 5, p = 0.0129), after 24 h of LPS 
      stimulation; including NO bioavailability after 24 h (102 ± 9 vs. 66 ± 5 μM/mL, 
      p = 0.0029) or 48 h (143 ± 8 vs. 119 ± 4 μM/mL, p = 0.0102) of LPS stimulation. 
      Moreover, the number of PP in the whole small intestine of DMK group was also 
      increased as compared to DM (22 ± 1 vs. 18 ± 1, p = 0.0292). CONCLUSION: These 
      results show that Kefir has a potential to modulate the immune response and activate 
      peritoneal macrophages in diabetic animals, which suggests that it could enhance the 
      immunocompetence of patients affected by diabetes mellitus. The hypoglycemic effect 
      of this probiotic could be used as a tool to control glycemia, reducing or delaying 
      the onset of complications associated with this disease.

      years 1995-2001].
PG  - 145-52
AB  - The microbiological quality of kefir (61 samples) and yoghurt (92 samples) purchased 
      in retail network in Warsaw in the years 1995 and 2001 has been examined. The total 
      number of bacteria in at least 90% of yoghurt and 73% of kefir was in the range 
      10(7)-10(9) c.f.u. in 1g. The dominating group of bacteria in kefir were mesophilic 
      lactic acid streptococci and in yoghurt (analysed in the year 2001)--S. 
      thermophilus. The number of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in 40% of samples was <

      milks has been observed. More than 86% of kefir and 97% of yoghurt analysed in 2001 
      were free from coliform bacteria, most of them free from B. cereus, moulds and

TI  - Investigating the Proteomic Profile of HT-29 Colon Cancer Cells After Lactobacillus 
      kefiri SGL 13 Exposure Using the SWATH Method.
PG  - 1690-1699
LID - 10.1007/s13361-019-02268-6 [doi]
AB  - Despite some studies revealed that kefir acts on different cancers, such as 
      colorectal cancer, the proteomic changes that occur in the colon cancer cells remain 
      to be explored. In this study, the proteomic analysis was combined with 
      determination of kefir characteristics (e.g., adhesion capacity, gastrointestinal 
      and antibiotic resistances), in order to confirm its use as a probiotic. Therefore, 
      a label-free strategy based on SWATH-MS was applied to investigate the proteomic 
      profile of HT-29 cells after exposure for 24 h to a specific strain of Lactobacillus 
      kefiri named SGL 13. We identified a total of 60 differentially expressed proteins 
      in HT-29 cells, among which most are located into the extracellular exosome, playing 
      important/crucial roles in translation and cell adhesion, as indicated by the 
      enrichment analysis. The eIF2 and retinoid X receptor activation pathways appeared 
      to be correlated with the anti-tumoral effect of SGL 13. Immunoblot analysis showed 
      an increase in Bax and a decrease in caspase 3 and mutant p53, and ELISA assay 
      revealed inhibition of IL-8 secretion from HT-29 cells stimulated with LPS upon SGL 
      13 treatment, suggesting pro-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory properties of kefir. In 
      conclusion, the results of this study, the first of its kind using co-culture of 
      kefir and colon cancer cells, demonstrate that L. kefiri SGL 13 possesses probiotic 
      potency and contribute to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the L. 
      kefiri-colon cancer cell interactions.

TI  - Use of JAR-Based Analysis for Improvement of Product Acceptance: A Case Study on 
      Flavored Kefirs.
PG  - 1200-1207
LID - 10.1111/1750-3841.13701 [doi]
AB  - A common question of dairy product developments is the possible success of the new 
      product. Several publications reported successful results using just-about-right 
      (JAR) scales; although there is some debate about their advantages/disadvantages. 
      This study highlights the limitations and opportunities of JAR scales and penalty 
      analysis of fruit flavored kefirs. The first question is whether penalty analysis 
      results help to improve the product and thus its overall liking (OAL)? The second 
      question is what happens to those who rated the products "ideal" (JAR) before 
      product development when evaluating the new products? Fruit flavored live-flora 
      stirred-type kefir samples were formulated and evaluated by 92 consumers before and 
      after the JAR-based product development. The OAL of two products significantly 
      increased after product development. A new visualization tool is introduced, which 
      shows what happens to those who rated the attribute as JAR but the attribute has 
      been modified. A general product development scheme is also introduced for JAR-based 
      kefir product development.

TI  - Living the Sweet Life: How Liquorilactobacillus hordei TMW 1.1822 Changes Its 
      Behavior in the Presence of Sucrose in Comparison to Glucose.
LID - 10.3390/foods9091150 [doi]
LID - 1150
AB  - Liquorilactobacillus (L.) hordei (formerly Lactobacillus hordei) is one of the 
      dominating lactic acid bacteria within the water kefir consortium, being highly 
      adapted to survive in this environment, while producing high molecular weight 
      dextrans from sucrose. In this work, we extensively studied the physiological 
      response of L. hordei TMW 1.1822 to sucrose compared to glucose, applying 
      label-free, quantitative proteomics of cell lysates and exoproteomes. This revealed 
      the differential expression of 53 proteins within cellular proteomes, mostly 
      associated with carbohydrate uptake and metabolism. Supported by growth experiments, 
      this suggests that L. hordei TMW 1.1822 favors fructose over other sugars. The 
      dextransucrase was expressed irrespectively of the present carbon source, while it 
      was significantly more released in the presence of sucrose (log(2)FC = 3.09), being 
      among the most abundant proteins within exoproteomes of sucrose-treated cells. 
      Still, L. hordei TMW 1.1822 expressed other sucrose active enzymes, predictively 
      competing with the dextransucrase reaction. While osmolysis appeared to be unlikely, 
      sucrose led to increased release of a multitude of cytoplasmic proteins, suggesting 
      that biofilm formation in L. hordei is not only composed of a polysaccharide matrix 
      but is also of proteinaceous nature. Therefore, our study highlights the intrinsic 
      adaptation of water kefir-borne L. hordei to sucrose-rich habitats and provides 
      fundamental knowledge for its use as a starter culture in plant-based food 
      fermentations with in situ dextran formation.

AB  - Monitoring pH within microbial reactors has become an important requirement across a 
      host of applications ranging from the production of functional foods (probiotics) to 
      biofuel cell systems. An inexpensive and scalable composite sensor capable of 
      monitoring the pH within the demanding environments posed by microbial reactors has 
      been developed. A custom designed flavin derivative bearing an electropolymerisable 
      phenol monomer was used to create a redox film sensitive to pH but free from the 
      interferences that can impede conventional pH systems. The film was integrated 
      within a composite carbon-fibre-polymer laminate and was shown to exhibit Nernstian 
      behaviour (55 mV/pH) with minimal drift and robust enough to operate within batch 
      reactors.

TI  - Deleterious Metabolic Effects of High Fructose Intake: The Preventive Effect of 
      Lactobacillus kefiri Administration.
LID - 10.3390/nu9050470 [doi]
LID - 470
AB  - Modern lifestyle and diets have been associated with metabolic disorders and an 
      imbalance in the normal gut microbiota. Probiotics are widely known for their health 
      beneficial properties targeting the gut microbial ecosystem. The aim of our study 
      was to evaluate the preventive effect of Lactobacillus kefiri (L. kefiri) 
      administration in a fructose-rich diet (FRD) mice model. Mice were provided with tap 
      water or fructose-added (20% w/v) drinking water supplemented or not with L. kefiri. 
      Results showed that probiotic administration prevented weight gain and epidydimal 
      adipose tissue (EAT) expansion, with partial reversion of the adipocyte hypertrophy 
      developed by FRD. Moreover, the probiotic prevented the increase of plasma 
      triglycerides and leptin, together with the liver triglyceride content. Leptin 
      adipocyte secretion was also improved by L. kefiri, being able to respond to an 
      insulin stimulus. Glucose intolerance was partially prevented by L. kefiri treatment 
      (GTT) and local inflammation (TNFα; IL1β; IL6 and INFγ) was completely inhibited in 
      EAT. L. kefiri supplementation generated an impact on gut microbiota composition, 
      changing Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes profiles. Overall, our results indicate that 
      the administration of probiotics prevents the deleterious effects of FRD intake and 
      should therefore be promoted to improve metabolic disorders.

TI  - Liquid chromatographic determination of thiamin in dairy products.
PG  - 345-9
AB  - Concentrations of thiamin were determined in pasteurized and UHT-sterilized milks, 
      yoghurt and kefir samples by high-performance liquid chromatography using a 
      reversed-phase C-18 column connected to fluorescence detector. The linearity, 
      recovery and reproducibility of the method were satisfactory. The thiamin content 
      ranged from 0.305 +/- 0.02 to 0.252 +/- 0.03 mg/l in market milks. Yoghurt samples 
      had higher concentration of thiamin (0.355 +/- 0.04 and 0.404 +/- 0.02 mg/l) than 
      values found in market milks. The least thiamin content was found in kefir (0.175 
      +/- 0.03 mg/l) among the samples analyzed.

PG  - 503-5
AB  - Heterofermentative lactobacilli have been isolated from kefir grains obtained from 
      four different sources. A number of these isolates ferment only L-arabinose and 
      gluconate and are similar to the species 'Lactobacillus desidiosus'. The DNA of 
      these isolates, however, have 85-109% homology with 'L. caucasicus' NCDO 190 which 
      is now regarded as L. kefir. The relationship between these strains is discussed.

TI  - An updated review on bacterial community composition of traditional fermented milk 
      products: what next-generation sequencing has revealed so far?
PG  - 1-20
LID - 10.1080/10408398.2020.1848787 [doi]
AB  - The emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has revolutionized 
      the way to investigate the microbial diversity in traditional fermentations. In the 
      field of food microbial ecology, different NGS platforms have been used for 
      community analysis, including 454 pyrosequencing from Roche, Illumina's instruments 
      and Thermo Fisher's SOLiD/Ion Torrent sequencers. These recent platforms generate 
      information about millions of rDNA amplicons in a single running, enabling accurate 
      phylogenetic resolution of microbial taxa. This review provides a comprehensive 
      overview of the application of NGS for microbiome analysis of traditional fermented 
      milk products worldwide. Fermented milk products covered in this review include 
      kefir, buttermilk, koumiss, dahi, kurut, airag, tarag, khoormog, lait caillé, and 
      suero costeño. Lactobacillus-mainly represented by Lb. helveticus, Lb. 
      kefiranofaciens, and Lb. delbrueckii-is the most important and frequent genus with 
      51 reported species. In general, dominant species detected by culturing were also 
      identified by NGS. However, NGS studies have revealed a more complex bacterial 
      diversity, with estimated 400-600 operational taxonomic units, comprising 
      uncultivable microorganisms, sub-dominant populations, and late-growing species. 
      This review explores the importance of these discoveries and address related topics 
      on workflow, NGS platforms, and knowledge bioinformatics devoted to fermented milk 
      products. The knowledge that has been gained is vital in improving the monitoring, 
      manipulation, and safety of these traditional fermented foods.

TI  - Estimation of the antioxidant activity of the commercially available fermented 
      milks.
PG  - 387-396
LID - 10.17306/J.AFS.2015.4.38 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Free radicals are connected with the increased risk of certain diseases, 
      especially cancers. There is some scientific evidence that antioxidant-rich diet may 
      inhibit the negative impact of free radicals. The aim of the present study was to 
      analyse the antioxidant capacity of the selected commercial natural and flavoured 
      fermented milks offered in Poland, derived from different producers. METHODS: The 
      following commercially available natural fermented milks: 12 yoghurts, 12 kefirs, 2 
      butter milks, 2 cultured milks, Turkish yoghurt drink (ayran) and the following 
      flavoured fermented milks: 22 yoghurts, 2 acidophillus milks, 2 kefirs, butter milk 
      and vegetable flavoured fermented milk were analysed for their antioxidant 
      potential. The antioxidant capacity was assessed, in two replicates and twice for 
      each product, by means of ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and DPPH radical 
      scavenging ability (expressed as ARP - anti radical power) methods. RESULTS: Among 
      all analysed plain products, yoghurts and kefirs were characterised by the highest 
      antioxidant activity. The presence of probiotic Lactobacillus casei strains in the 
      product positively affected both FRAP and ARP values. Antioxidant capacity of the 
      flavoured fermented milks was primarily affected by the type and quality (e.g. fruit 
      concentration) of the added flavouring preparation. The most valuable regarding the 
      estimated parameters were chocolate, coffee, grapefruit with green tea extract as 
      well as bilberry, forest fruits, strawberry and cherry with blackcurrant fillings. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Protein content, inclusion of probiotic microflora as well as type and 
      quality of flavouring preparations are the main factors affecting antioxidant 
      properties of fermented milks.

TI  - Lactobacillus kefiri shows inter-strain variations in the amino acid sequence of the 
      S-layer proteins.
PG  - 515-530
LID - 10.1007/s10482-016-0820-4 [doi]
AB  - The S-layer is a proteinaceous envelope constituted by subunits that self-assemble 
      to form a two-dimensional lattice that covers the surface of different species of 
      Bacteria and Archaea, and it could be involved in cell recognition of microbes among 
      other several distinct functions. In this work, both proteomic and genomic 
      approaches were used to gain knowledge about the sequences of the S-layer protein 
      (SLPs) encoding genes expressed by six aggregative and sixteen non-aggregative 
      strains of potentially probiotic Lactobacillus kefiri. Peptide mass fingerprint 
      (PMF) analysis confirmed the identity of SLPs extracted from L. kefiri, and based on 
      the homology with phylogenetically related species, primers located outside and 
      inside the SLP-genes were employed to amplify genomic DNA. The O-glycosylation site 
      SASSAS was found in all L. kefiri SLPs. Ten strains were selected for sequencing of 
      the complete genes. The total length of the mature proteins varies from 492 to 576 
      amino acids, and all SLPs have a calculated pI between 9.37 and 9.60. The N-terminal 
      region is relatively conserved and shows a high percentage of positively charged 
      amino acids. Major differences among strains are found in the C-terminal region. 
      Different groups could be distinguished regarding the mature SLPs and the 
      similarities observed in the PMF spectra. Interestingly, SLPs of the aggregative 
      strains are 100% homologous, although these strains were isolated from different 
      kefir grains. This knowledge provides relevant data for better understanding of the 
      mechanisms involved in SLPs functionality and could contribute to the development of 
      products of biotechnological interest from potentially probiotic bacteria.

TI  - Antioxidative effects in vivo and colonization of Lactobacillus plantarum MA2 in the 
      murine intestinal tract.

AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum MA2 was isolated from traditional Chinese Tibet kefir 
      grains, which possess several excellent properties and functions. We previously 
      demonstrated the antioxidant activities of this bacterium in vitro. However, the 
      maintenance and survival of L. plantarum MA2 inside the murine intestinal tract, 
      where it exerts its probiotic properties, and whether its effects are elicited 
      directly on the host remain unknown. Therefore, this study investigated the 
      mechanisms of L. plantarum MA2 in aging mice following D-galactose administration. 
      The levels of malondialdehyde decreased significantly in the L. plantarum MA2 groups 
      after oral ingestion compared to the D-galactose model group, and total antioxidant 
      capacity and glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities increased 
      significantly in the serum and liver. We combined fluorescein isothiocyanate 
      labeling and green fluorescent protein expression to dynamically monitor the 
      colonization and distribution of L. plantarum MA2 in the murine intestinal tract. 
      The results indicated that L. plantarum MA2 was detected in the ileum, colon, and 
      feces after single and continuous oral administration at day 21 and was maintained 
      at 10(4)-10(5) CFU/g. These results suggest that L. plantarum MA2 colonizes and 
      survives in the murine intestinal tract to exert its antioxidative effects.

TI  - Real-Time Monitoring of Chemical Changes in Three Kinds of Fermented Milk Products 
      during Fermentation Using Quantitative Difference Nuclear Magnetic Resonance 
      Spectroscopy.
PG  - 1479-1487

AB  - Fermented milk products are rising in popularity throughout the world as a result of 
      their health benefits, including improving digestion, normalizing the function of 
      the immune system, and aiding in weight management. This study applies an in situ 
      quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance method to monitor chemical changes in three 
      kinds of fermented milk products, Bulgarian yogurt, Caspian Sea yogurt, and kefir, 
      during fermentation. As a result, the concentration changes in nine organic 
      compounds, α/β-lactose, α/β-galactose, lactic acid, citrate, ethanol, lecithin, and 
      creatine, were monitored in real time. This revealed three distinct metabolic 
      processes in the three fermented milk products. Moreover, pH changes were also 
      determined by variations in the chemical shift of citric acid during the 
      fermentation processes. These results can be applied to estimate microbial 
      metabolism in various flora and help guide the fermentation and storage of various 
      fermented milk products to improve their quality, which may directly influence human 
      health.

TI  - Probiotic properties of yeasts isolated from chicken feces and kefirs.
PG  - 257-63
AB  - The probiotic potential of 3 yeasts strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae isolated 
      from kefirs and feces was investigated and compared with 3 isolates from medicines 
      and 2 collection strains (ATCC) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii. Genetic 
      identification of yeasts based on karyotypes indicated their affiliation to 
      Saccharomyces spp. although chromosomal polymorphism was observed. Concerning 
      probiotic characteristics survival in simulated gastric and intestinal environment 
      were examined. The survival of all tested yeasts in medium of pH 2.5 was comparable 
      and equaled 86.8-97.1% after 8 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C. The fecal 
      isolate, probiotic and collection yeasts showed also high resistance to pH 1.5 and 
      their survival was 85.3-92.1%, whereas for kefir strains it amounted to 33.1 and 
      38.9%. All yeasts tested demonstrated high resistance to synthetic bile salts as 
      well. In the presence of 0.1% sodium cholate and sodium deoxycholate the reduction 
      of cell number by only 1 log unit after 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees C was 
      observed. However, 1.0% addition of ox bile did not affect their viability. In 
      simulated gastric and intestinal environment survival of fecal, probiotic and 
      collection strains was 86.3-93.7% after 4 hours of incubation in media with addition 
      of 3 g/l pepsin and 1 g/l pancreatin. Kefir isolates were more sensitive to these 
      conditions and a further 10% reduction of cell number in relation to probiotic 
      yeasts was observed. The tested strains, except for kefir isolates, were able to 
      grow at 37 degrees C. All the tested strains survived in sufficient number to create 
      the possibility of proper action in the human body, although fecal, probiotic and 
      collection strains tolerated the conditions of the human gastrointestinal tract 
      better than food-borne yeasts.

PG  - 219-24
AB  - Propagable and non-propagable kefir grains in a form resembling cauliflower florets 
      were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy. In 
      propagable grains short and long rod-shaped bacteria and yeasts formed separate 
      colonies on the outside surface and inside. Internally, filaments which derived from 
      capsules around the cells extended radially from a population of long rod-shaped 
      bacteria. In non-propagable grains long rod-shaped bacteria with filamentous 
      appendages were not observed, but only short rod-shaped bacteria and yeasts. Indian 
      ink preparations showed presence of encapsulated bacteria in propagable grains and 
      absence of these in non-propagable ones. The above results suggest that encapsulated 
      bacteria are responsible for propagation of kefir grains.

LID - 10.4297/najms.2010.15 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic microorganisms are potential treatments for Clostridium 
      difficile diarrheal disease (CDD) but better methods are needed to determine the 
      relative potency of probiotic microorganisms against pathogenic organisms in mixed 
      cultures. AIM: Quantify C. difficile in the presence of putative probiotic organisms 
      using molecular methods to determine relative probiotic potency. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: C. difficile strains were cultivated anaerobically. Serial dilutions of 
      Lactobacillus cultures or microbial mixtures from kefir were co-cultured with C. 
      difficile for 48 hours. Bacterial DNA was extracted and qPCR was used to measure C. 
      difficile toxin A gene, on the basis of cycle threshold (Ct) number. RESULTS: 
      Strains of Lactobacillus (human and ATCC derived), and mixed cultures from 
      commercial kefir were co-cultured with C. difficile. Lactobacillus and the microbial 
      mixture from kefir were ranked in order of their potency in C. difficile growth 
      inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: PCR allows facile quantification of C. difficle in the 
      presence of other. The technique measures relative potency of over-the-counter 
      probiotics and may predict human strains meriting probiotic status.

TI  - Dual function of Lactobacillus kefiri DH5 in preventing high-fat-diet-induced 
      obesity: direct reduction of cholesterol and upregulation of PPAR-α in adipose 
      tissue.
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.201700252 [doi]
AB  - SCOPE: Kefir consumption inhibits the development of obesity and non-alcoholic fatty 
      liver disease (NALFD) in mice fed 60% high-fat diet (HFD). To identify the key 
      contributor of this effect, we isolated lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from kefir and 
      examined their anti-obesity properties from in vitro screening and in vivo 
      validation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirteen kefir LAB isolates were subjected to 
      survivability test using artificial gastrointestinal environment and 
      cholesterol-reducing assay. Lactobacillus kefiri DH5 showed 100% survivability in 
      gastrointestinal environments and reduced 51.6% of cholesterol; thus, this strain 
      was selected for in vivo experiment. Compared to the HFD-saline group, the HFD-DH5 
      group showed significantly lower body weight (34.68 versus 31.10 g; p < 0.001), 
      epididymal adipose tissue weight (1.39 versus 1.05 g; p < 0.001), blood triglyceride 
      (38.2 versus 31.0 mg/dL; p < 0.01) and LDL-cholesterol levels (19.4 versus 15.7 
      mg/dL; p < 0.01). In addition, L. kefiri DH5 administration significantly modulated 
      gut microbiota of HFD-fed mice. The hepatic steatosis was significantly milder 
      (Lesion score, 2.1 versus 1.2; p < 0.001) and adipocyte diameter was significantly 
      smaller (65.1 versus 42.2 μm; p < 0.001) in the HFD-DH5 group. L. kefiri DH5 
      upregulated PPAR-α, FABP4, and CPT1 expression in the epididymal adipose tissues 
      (2.29-, 1.77-, and 2.05-fold change, respectively), suggesting a reduction in 
      adiposity by stimulating fatty acid oxidation. CONCLUSION: L. kefiri DH5 exerts 
      anti-obesity effects by direct reduction of cholesterol in the lumen and 
      upregulation of PPAR-α gene in adipose tissues.

TI  - Modulation of gut microbiota and increase in fecal water content in mice induced by 
      administration of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens DN1.
PG  - 680-686
LID - 10.1039/c6fo01559j [doi]
AB  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens is the key probiotic bacterium in kefir. In this 
      study, we investigated the effects of oral consumption of L. kefiranofaciens on the 
      fecal quality and intestinal microbiota of mice. Four-week-old Balb/c mice were 
      divided into two groups (n = 8 each) and administered 0.2 mL of saline (control 
      group) or saline containing 2 × 10(8) cfu L. kefiranofaciens DN1 (LKF_DN1 group) for 
      two weeks. At the end of the experiment, their fecal samples were collected and the 
      fecal quality and microbiota were assessed. The LKF_DN1 group exhibited higher total 
      fecal weight and fecal weight per stool sample than the control group (p < 0.05). 
      Interestingly, the fecal water content was significantly higher in the fecal samples 
      of the LKF_DN1 group than in those of the control group (p < 0.05). The numbers of 
      total bacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Lactobacillus, and Prevotella were 
      significantly higher in the LKF_DN1 group than in the control group (p < 0.05). In 
      contrast, the number of opportunistic pathogens, including Proteobacteria and 
      Enterobacteriaceae, and the percentage of genus Clostridium among the total bacteria 
      were significantly reduced in the LKF_DN1 group (p < 0.05). Our data suggest that 
      regular L. kefiranofaciens DN1 administration could alleviate constipation and 
      improve gut microbiota.

      delignified cellulosic material for whey treatment.
PG  - 461-4
AB  - Kefir yeast cells immobilized on Delignified Cellulosic Materials (DCM) is proposed 
      as a suitable form of biocatalyst for whey treatment. A bioreactor of 11.000L was 
      used in all experiments. 5 repeated batch fermentations were taken place with whey 
      volumes of 3000L and 5000L. Fermentation times achieved were below 15 h and final 
      ethanol concentration was of the level of 2%v/v. Residual sugar was low while 
      conversion rate reached 95%. In a second frame of experiments the immobilized cells 
      bioreactor was operated on a feed-batch process, beginning from 2000L of whey and 
      adding 2000L in every feed. In a third frame of experiments, whey fermentation was 
      performed on a continuous operation for a period of 13 days. The system retained its 
      operational stability, exhibiting relatively high ethanol yield and ethanol 
      productivity. All experiments indicated that the biocatalyst of kefir yeast cells 
      immobilized on delignified cellulosic materials has a carry through property on whey 
      fermentation on industrial scale.

TI  - The influence of the dose of calcium bisglycinate on physicochemical properties, 
      sensory analysis and texture profile of kefirs during 21 days of cold storage.
PG  - 37-45
LID - 10.17306/J.AFS.2016.1.4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In the process of enrichment of dairy products a priority element is the 
      proper selection of compounds that are a mineral carrier. Calcium bisglycinate is 
      better absorbed by the body than inorganic forms of calcium. Moreover, the lactic 
      acid which is produced in kefir fermentation and the presence of lactose have also a 
      positive effect on the improvement of absorption of calcium. The aim of the present 
      study was to determine the influence of the applied dose of calcium in the form of 
      calcium bisglycinate on the physicochemical and sensory properties and texture of 
      kefirs during 21-day period of cold storage. METHODS: Processed cow milk was 
      enriched with 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mg of calcium (for 100 g of milk), 
      repasteurized (72°C, 1 min), cooled down (26°C), inoculated with Commercial VITAL 
      kefir culture (Danisco, Poland) and fermented for 16 hours (26°C). The assessment of 
      the influence of addition   of calcium bisglycinate on acidity, syneresis, texture 
      and sensory characteristics (1-9 points) of kefirs was conducted at four fixed dates 
      (after 1 day, 7 days, 14 days and 21 days of storage). RESULTS: During successive 
      weeks of cold storage in all experimental groups there was observed a tendency to 
      decrease general acidity. On the 1st and 7th days of cold storage reduced whey 
      leakage was observed in kefirs enriched with 25 mg and 30 mg Ca/100 g of milk. With 
      increasing doses of enrichment with calcium both the hardness, adhesiveness and 
      gumminess of kefirs decreased. The applied doses of calcium did not cause changes in 
      the sensory characteristics such as colour and consistency of the fermented 
      beverages. CONCLUSIONS: Calcium bisglycinate may be used to enrich kefirs with 
      calcium even with 30 mg of calcium in 100 g of milk without the modification of the 
      product's parameters.

      tract and promotes improvement of indicators of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. 
      It is important for patients with overweight and type 2 diabetes. Positive 
      improvements of research allow making a cereal breakfast use recommendations: muesli 
      in number of 50 g/days (with milk or kefir), crispbread and crunchy snacks in number 
      of 100 g/days in SRK patients with functional chronic constipation dietary

TI  - Kefir improves fatty liver syndrome by inhibiting the lipogenesis pathway in 
      leptin-deficient ob/ob knockout mice.
PG  - 1172-9
LID - 10.1038/ijo.2013.236 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fatty liver disease is commonly associated with obesity, insulin 
      resistance and diabetes. Severe fatty liver is sometimes accompanied by 
      steatohepatitis and may lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. At 
      present, there is no effective treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease 
      (NAFLD); thus, recent investigations have focused on developing effective 
      therapeutics to treat this condition. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of 
      kefir on the hepatic lipid metabolism of ob/ob mice, which are commonly used to 
      model fatty liver disease. RESULTS: In this study, we used leptin receptor-deficient 
      ob/ob mice as an animal disease model of NAFLD. Six-week-old ob/ob mice were orally 
      administered the dairy product kefir (140 mg kg(-1) of body weight (BW) per day) for 
      4 weeks. The data demonstrated that kefir improved fatty liver syndrome on BW, 
      energy expenditure and basal metabolic rate by inhibiting serum glutamate 
      oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT) activities 
      (P<0.05) and by decreasing the triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) contents 
      of the liver (P<0.05). Oral kefir administration also significantly reduced the 
      macrovesicular fat quantity in liver tissue. In addition, kefir markedly decreased 
      the expression of the genes sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1), 
      fatty acid synthase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (P<0.05) but not the 
      expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) or hepatic 
      carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT1α) in the livers of ob/ob mice. CONCLUSION: 
      On the basis of these results, we conclude that kefir improves NAFLD on BW, energy 
      expenditure and basal metabolic rate by inhibiting the lipogenesis pathway and that 
      kefir may have the potential for clinical application to the prevention or treatment 
      of NAFLD.

AB  - The aim of the work was to determine the effect of pressurization under 700 and 1000 
      MPa on the following: biochemical and antibacterial activity of individual strains 
      of streptococci and lactobacilli, isolated from kefir inoculum, and of kefir 
      microflora. After pressurization under 1000 MPa, the studied microorganisms lost 
      their ability to inhibit the growth of the test strains, preserving the 
      aroma-producing ability at the same time. The pressure of 1000 MPa caused also the 
      changes in conformation of lactic acid, produced by the bacteria in skim milk 
      culture. The changes in metabolism of the isolated bacteria, as being the result of 
      pressurization under 700 MPa were dependent on the strain of microorganisms.

TI  - Freeze-Dried Immobilized Kefir Culture in Low Alcohol Winemaking.
LID - 10.3390/foods9020115 [doi]
LID - 115
AB  - Low alcohol wines represent a rising trend in the global market. Since for ethanol 
      removal, certain physicochemical methods that negatively affect wine quality are 
      applied, the aim of this present study was to evaluate the efficiency of 
      freeze-dried, immobilized kefir culture on natural supports (apple pieces, grape 
      skins and delignified cellulosic material) in low alcohol winemaking at various 
      temperatures (5-30 °C). Initially, genetic analysis of kefir culture was performed 
      by Next Generation Sequencing. There was an immobilization of kefir culture on grape 
      skins-enhanced cell survival during freeze-drying in most cases, even when no 
      cryoprotectant was used. Simultaneous alcoholic and malolactic fermentations were 
      performed in repeated batch fermentations for >12 months, using freeze-dried free or 
      immobilized cells produced with no cryoprotectant, suggesting the high operational 
      stability of the systems. Values of great industrial interest for daily ethanol 
      productivity and malic acid conversion [up to 39.5 g/(Ld) and 67.3%, respectively] 
      were recorded. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) showed that freeze-drying rather 
      than the fermentation temperature affected significantly minor volatiles. All low 
      alcohol wines produced were accepted during the preliminary sensory evaluation.

AB  - The natural mixed culture kefir was immobilized on boiled corn grains to produce an 
      efficient biocatalyst for lactic acid fermentation with direct applications in food 
      production, such as sourdough bread making. The immobilized biocatalyst was 
      initially evaluated for its efficiency for lactic acid production by fermentation of 
      cheese whey at various temperatures. The immobilized cells increased the 
      fermentation rate and enhanced lactic acid production compared to free kefir cells. 
      Maximum lactic acid yield (68.8 g/100 g) and lactic acid productivity (12.6 g/L per 
      day) were obtained during fermentation by immobilized cells at 37 °C. The 
      immobilized biocatalyst was then assessed as culture for sourdough bread making. The 
      produced sourdough breads had satisfactory specific loaf volumes and good sensory 
      characteristics. Specifically, bread made by addition of 60% w/w sourdough 
      containing kefir immobilized on corn was more resistant regarding mould spoilage 
      (appearance during the 11(th) day), probably due to higher lactic acid produced 
      (2.86 g/Kg of bread) compared to the control samples. The sourdough breads made with 
      the immobilized biocatalyst had aroma profiles similar to that of the control 
      samples as shown by headspace SPME GC-MS analysis.

TI  - Kefiran suppresses antigen-induced mast cell activation.
PG  - 178-83
AB  - Kefir is a traditional fermented milk beverage produced by kefir grains in the 
      Caucasian countries. Kefiran produced by Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens in kefir 
      grains is an exopolysaccharide having a repeating structure with glucose and 
      galactose residues in the chain sequence and has been suggested to exert many 
      health-promoting effects such as immunomodulatory, hypotensive, hypocholesterolemic 
      activities. Here we investigated the effects of kefiran on mast cell activation 
      induced by antigen. Pretreatment with kefiran significantly inhibited 
      antigen-induced Ca(2+) mobilization, degranulation, and tumor necrosis factor-α 
      production in bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) in a dose-dependent manner. The 
      phosphorylation of Akt, glycogen synthase kinase 3β, and extracellular 
      signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) after antigen stimulation was also suppressed by 
      pretreatment of BMMCs with kefiran. These findings indicate that kefiran suppresses 
      mast cell degranulation and cytokine production by inhibiting the Akt and ERKs 
      pathways, suggesting an anti-inflammatory effect for kefiran.

TI  - Organic acids and volatile flavor components evolved during refrigerated storage of 
      kefir.
PG  - 275-7
AB  - Kefir samples were prepared and transferred to sterile jars for storage at 4 degrees 
      C. After 0, 7, 14, and 21 d of storage, the pH, organic acid, and volatile flavor 
      component content were determined to monitor possible flavor changes during storage. 
      Stored samples were analyzed for organic acid (orotic, citric, pyruvic, lactic, 
      uric, acetic, propionic, butyric, and hippuric) content by HPLC with UV detection at 
      275 nm. Acetoin, ethanol, acetaldehyde, and diacetyl were monitored using gas 
      chromatography equipped with a headspace autosampler. There was no significant 
      decrease in average pH of samples between d 0 and 21 of storage (P>0.05). Lactic 
      acid concentration increased during storage, reaching a maximum of 7739 ppm by d 21. 
      Orotic and citric acids increased slightly during storage. Although pyruvic and 
      hippuric acids are produced during fermentation, neither was detected during 
      storage. Acetic, propionic, and butyric acids were not detected during kefir 
      storage. Ethanol concentrations increased during storage and reached 0.08% by d 21. 
      The amounts of acetaldehyde and acetoin, common flavor substances in many cultured 
      dairy products, increased during fermentation. Acetaldehyde content in kefir samples 
      doubled from d 0 to 21, reaching a final concentration of 11 microg/g. During 
      storage, the concentration of acetoin decreased from 25 ppm on d 0 to 16 ppm on d 
      21. However, diacetyl, another common flavor component in cultured dairy products, 
      was not detected during fermentation or storage.

TI  - Effect of special Hungarian probiotic kefir on faecal microflora.
PG  - 1129-32
AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of a four-week consumption of a special Hungarian 
      probiotic agent (Biofir) on the faecal microflora in human healthy subjects. 
      METHODS: The effect of Biofir with 10(6)/cm3 initial germs on the faecal microflora 
      was studied in 120 healthy volunteers (71 females, 49 males). The traditional 
      Russian type kefir was used as control. The various germ groups and pH values were 
      determined in wk 2, 4 and 6. RESULTS: The number of all microbes increased during 
      the 4-week probiotic treatment. The number of microbes increased 4.3-fold in the 
      control group and 6.8-fold in Biofir-treated group. The probiotic kefir caused 
      multiplication of the probiotic flora, meanwhile the undesired bacteria multiplied 
      in the control group. No significant change of pH values of the faeces was found in 
      both groups. CONCLUSION: The Hungarian probiotic kefir (Biofir) is capable of 
      promoting multiplication of probiotic bacterial flora in the large bowel.

TI  - Rapid discrimination of lactobacilli isolated from kefir grains by FT-IR 
      spectroscopy.
PG  - 280-7
AB  - Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used in combination with 
      multivariate statistical analysis for differentiation of lactic bacteria isolated 
      from kefir grains. Twelve reference strains and 42 lactobacilli isolates from four 
      local kefir grains, previously identified by biochemical traditional techniques at 
      species level were included in this study. The spectra were analysed by hierarchical 
      clustering analysis (HCA) using Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient and 
      Ward's algorithm. The differentiation between homo- and heterofermentative 
      lactobacilli, proposed as a first level in the classification scheme, was performed 
      with vector normalized first derivatives spectra in the windows 1789-1700, 1059-935, 
      3000-2927 and 896-833 cm(-1). For heterofermentative lactobacilli the windows 
      1780-1750, 1500-1200, 2950-2930 and 900-700 cm(-1) were found to contribute to the 
      maximal separation among L. kefir, L. parakefir and Lactobacillus brevis. It was 
      also demonstrated that although this model was robust against small variations in 
      growth temperature (+/-5 degrees C) and growth time (+/-5 h), the make of culture 
      medium used (Biokar or Difco) affected the separation of heterofermentative 
      lactobacilli at species level. For homofermentative lactobacilli the spectral 
      regions 1230-900, 1777-1690, 1357-1240 and 2960-2870 cm(-1), were selected for 
      discrimination among 5 different species that are normally present in kefir grains: 
      L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. kefirgranum, L. kefiranofaciens and L. cassei. The 
      classification and discrimination schemes proposed in this work completely matched 
      with the identification obtained by classical biochemical techniques at species 
      level.

TI  - Testing the corrosion resistance of stainless steels during the fermentation of 
      probiotic drink.
PG  - 1293-7
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.4315 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over recent years, food producers have devoted much attention to the 
      production of safe foods. Simultaneously, using advanced process technologies, it 
      has been necessary to carefully select materials for use in process equipment. Milk 
      and its products are exposed to metal surfaces from the time they are processed, 
      through the various stages of handling and manufacture, to the packaging of the 
      finished products for market. The selection of suitable materials for daily use in 
      the dairy industry cannot be governed solely by their price and mechanical 
      properties but must also take into consideration their influence on the quality of 
      milk products. RESULTS: This paper presents the results of testing the corrosion 
      resistance of three stainless steels during the fermentation of a specific probiotic 
      drink, kefir. Experiments were conducted using preliminarily activated kefir grains 
      as a starter culture. Corrosion resistance was studied using a gravimetric and two 
      electrochemical methods. The two steels showing the best corrosion performance 
      differed mainly in their Mo and Nb contents. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that 
      Nb played the most protective role against corrosion during kefir fermentation, 
      since the steel containing Nb but no Mo showed the lowest corrosion rate.

TI  - [Effect of different types of feeding on the fatty acid makeup of the blood serum in 
      premature infants].
PG  - 44-9
AB  - The composition of fatty acids and the content of total serum lipids were studied in 
      65 virtually healthy premature infants on varying types of feeding, natural and 
      mixed ones (supplemented with kefir and a mixture of the "Similak" type). It was 
      established that the composition of blood serum fatty acids in premature infants on 
      natural feeding is marked by age-specific features. The differences in the content 
      of blood serum fatty acids among children on natural feeding and those whose food 
      was supplemented by kefir and a mixture of the "Similak" type were consequent on the 
      specificity of lipid fatty acids from the food given. Good tolerance, adequate 
      weight gain and a high content of indispensable fatty acids in blood serum were 
      attained as a result of the research described. Therefore it is recommended that 
      whole kefir and the mixture of the "Similak" type may be used for feeding premature 
      infants.

TI  - An evaluation of kefir grain size with magnetic resonance imaging to observe the 
      fermentation of milk.
PG  - 730-737
LID - 10.1002/mrc.4853 [doi]
AB  - Kefirian milk is a fermented beverage consumed worldwide. Originally produced in 
      animal skins, it is now prepared both industrially and at home by adding symbiotic 
      cultures of bacteria and yeast known as kefir grains to fresh milk. There is 
      significant literature on the biological aspects of this process but little focus on 
      the fermentation effects on the bulk milk as a function of the grain morphology. 
      Changes in the Magnetic Resonance (MR) signal as measured using a whole body 
      clinical magnetic resonance imaging scanner are found to be proportional to 
      traditional gas measurements with correlation coefficients in excess of 0.95. 
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging is then also used to determine the effect of grain size 
      on the rate of fermentation of milk. It is found that larger grains result in signal 
      intensity changes on the order of 0.03 a.u per hour, but by breaking the grains into 
      pieces around 3mm, the reaction rate can be more than doubled to 0.07 a.u. per hour. 
      It is thought that this shows promise as a method to improve the speed of production 
      of kefirian milk and by arresting the process partway through fermentation, gives 
      control over the properties of the end product.

AB  - Kefir is a beverage obtained by fermentation of milk or sugar solution by lactic 
      acid bacteria and yeasts, and several health benefits have been attributed to its 
      ingestion, part of them being attributed to Lactobacillus species. The objective of 
      the present study was to evaluate, in vivo, the probiotic potential of Lactobacillus 
      diolivorans 1Z, isolated from Brazilian kefir grains. Initially, conventional mice 
      were orally treated daily or not during 10 days with a suspension of L. diolivorans 
      1Z, and then orally challenged with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. 
      Treatment with L. diolivorans 1Z resulted in higher survival (70%) of animals after 
      the challenge with the pathogen than for not treated mice (0%). When germ-free mice 
      were monoassociated (GN-PS group) or not (GN-CS group) with L. diolivorans 1Z and 
      challenged after 7 days with S. Typhimurium, Salmonella fecal counts were 
      significantly lower (P < 0.05) for the GN-PS group when compared to the GN-CS group. 
      Histopathological analysis revealed less damage to the ileum mucosa, as demonstrated 
      by smallest perimeter of major lesions for mice of the GN-PS group in comparison to 
      the group GN-CS (P < 0.05). These findings were accompanied by a lower expression of 
      IFN-γ and TNF-α in the intestinal tissue of GN-PS mice. Additionally, translocation 
      of S. Typhimurium to liver was significantly lower in GN-PS than in GN-CS mice (P < 
      0.05), and IgA levels in intestinal content and number of Kupffer cells in liver 
      were higher. No difference was observed for hepatic cellularity between GN-PS and 
      GN-CS groups (P > 0.05), but the pattern of inflammatory cells present in the liver 
      was predominantly of polymorphonuclear in GN-CS group and of mononuclear in the 
      GN-PS group, and a higher hepatic expression of IL-10 and TGF-β was observed in 
      GN-PS group. Concluding, L. diolivorans 1Z showed to be a potential probiotic strain 
      that protected mice from death after challenge with S. Typhimurium, apparently by 
      immunological modulation.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease and food allergies are a growing topic in the field of 
      nutrition science. Polyphenols, which are the most important secondary metabolites 
      of plants, demonstrated to modulate the expression and/or production of numerous 
      proteins, but also to regulate the intestinal ecosystem. In this context, our aim 
      was the investigation of protective effects against the gastrointestinal mucosa of 
      fortified milk kefir obtained by adding seeds extract from Sangiovese cv. Pomace. 
      Methods: An ultrasound-assisted method was used to obtain the extracts. All the 
      extracts were assayed for the antioxidant activity. The best extract was used as an 
      additive of fermented milk kefir to obtain a fortified final product. Kefir samples 
      were analyzed by NMR spectroscopy. The efficiency of the barrier functions was 
      evaluated by measuring trans-epithelial electric resistance (TEER) using a 
      voltmeter. Results: the enriched kefir (Ksgn) possesses higher antioxidant 
      performances compared to the unfortified sample (Kwht). Kwht and Ksgn did not alter 
      Caco-2 TEER in basal condition.

TI  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activity of peptides derived from caprine 
      kefir.
PG  - 3480-7
AB  - In this study, a potent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity was 
      found in a commercial kefir made from caprine milk. The low molecular mass peptides 
      released from caseins during fermentation were mainly responsible for this activity. 
      Sixteen peptides were identified by HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry. Two of these 
      peptides, with sequences PYVRYL and LVYPFTGPIPN, showed potent ACE-inhibitory 
      properties. The impact of gastrointestinal digestion on ACE-inhibitory activity of 
      kefir peptides was also evaluated. Some of these peptides were resistant to the 
      incubation with pepsin followed by hydrolysis with Corolase PP. The ACE-inhibitory 
      activity after simulated digestion was similar to or slightly lower than 
      unhydrolyzed peptides, except for peptide beta-casein f(47-52) (DKIHPF), which 
      exhibited an activity 8 times greater after hydrolysis.

TI  - Some probiotic characteristics of a fermented milk product based on microbiota of 
      "Tibetan kefir grains" cultivated in Ukrainian household.
PG  - 252-257
LID - 10.1007/s13197-017-2931-y [doi]
AB  - The article describes some probiotic properties of fermented product made of natural 
      association of Tibetan kefir grains cultivated in Ukrainian household (UTKG); also, 
      the effect of UTKG microbiota on the growth of pathogenic microbiota and sensitivity 
      to antibiotics was studied. It was found that the test-cultures of oppurtunistic 
      pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus mesentericus, and Mycobacterium luteum) 
      were sensitive; bacteriostatic zone of the test-culture ranged from 21 to 25 mm, and 
      highly sensitive (Proteus vulgaris and Aspergillus niger) bacteriostatic zone 
      exceeded 25 mm to probiotic bacteria of fermented product. UTKG microbiota is also 
      moderately sensitive to multiple antibiotics that allows defining the obtained 
      fermented milk product as functional with therapeutic properties. During the study 
      of the influence of different NaCl and bile concentrations on acid-activity of UTKG 
      it was found that active acid formation occurred at the concentrations up to 4% NaCl 
      in cultivation medium (boiled milk) and at 20% bile and 0.45% phenol. It proves 
      microbial association to be capable of withstanding adverse gastrointestinal 
      conditions and continue developing.

      electronic literature search was conducted and in total six animal studies which 
      undertake twelve experiments met our inclusion criteria. We used the percentage (%) 
      of wound area at the end of the first week after initial wounding to evaluate the 
      efficacy of the probiotic treatment. The heterogeneity was estimated as 
      statistically significant (p<0.0001) and therefore the meta-analysis was performed 
      with the random-effect model. Based on the estimated Hedges' g (Hedges, 1982), the 
      administration of probiotics was associated with acceleration of the wound 
      contraction (g=-2.55; 95%CI=-3.59, -1.50; p<0.0001). The meta-regression analysis 
      showed that the moderator sterile kefir extract has the greater effect on the 
      overall estimated efficacy of probiotic treatment (g=-5.6983; p=0.0442) with 
      bacteria probiotic therapies (70% kefir gel, L. brevis, L. fermentum, L. plantarum, 
      L. reuteri) following (g=-2.3814; p=0.0003). For bacteria dose moderator, the 
      results showed that increase in bacterial dose corresponds to increase of the 
      estimated overall effect size (g=-10.2056; p=0.0053). The linear regression test of 
      funnel plot asymmetry showed absence of publication bias. In conclusion, the results 
      indicate that probiotics administration is an effective pharmacological treatment of 
      cutaneous wounds. However, due to the heterogeneity among studies, further research 
      is required.

AB  - The microbial community composition and chemical characteristics of a Brazilian milk 
      kefir sample produced during its manufacturing and refrigerated storage were 
      investigated by culture-dependent and -independent methods and HPLC. Lactococcus 
      lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Acetobacter 
      lovaniensis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated, whereas the detected bands 
      on denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis corresponded to Lactobacillus 
      kefiranofaciens, Lactobacillus kefiri, Lactobacillus parakefiri, and S. cerevisiae. 
      After fermentation, lactic acid bacteria were present at levels of 10 log units, 
      whereas acetic acid bacteria and yeast were present at levels of 7.8 and 6 log 
      units, respectively. The lactic acid bacteria and yeast counts remained constant, 
      whereas acetic acid bacteria counts decreased to 7.2 log units during storage. From 
      fermentation to final storage, the pH, lactose content and citric acid of the kefir 
      beverage decreased, followed by an increase in the concentrations of glucose, 
      galactose, ethanol, and lactic, acetic, butyric, and propionic acids. These 
      microbiological and chemical characteristics contribute to the unique taste and 
      aroma of kefir. This research may serve as a basis for the future industrial 
      production of this beverage in Brazil.

AB  - The microflora of Tibetan kefir grains was investigated by culture- independent 
      methods. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of partially amplified 16S 
      rRNA for bacteria and 26S rRNA for yeasts, followed by sequencing of the most 
      intense bands, showed that the dominant microorganisms were Pseudomonas sp., 
      Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, 
      Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus kefiri, Lactobacillus casei, Kazachstania 
      unispora, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Kazachstania 
      exigua. The bacterial communities between three kinds of Tibetan kefir grains showed 
      78-84% similarity, and yeasts 80-92%. The microflora is held together in the matrix 
      of fibrillar material composed largely of a water-insoluble polysaccharide.

TI  - Lactose uptake rate by kefir yeast using 14C-labelled lactose to explain kinetic 
      aspects in its fermentation.
PG  - 5210-3
LID - 10.1016/j.biortech.2009.05.016 [doi]
AB  - Tauhe present work shows the relation between kefir fermentation ability and 
      carbohydrate uptake rate. This was examined in a model system containing kefir 
      co-culture and lactose in order to study fermentation induced by yeasts and bacteria 
      at the same time. Lactose uptake rate was recorded by using (14)C-labelled lactose. 
      The effect of lactose, cell concentration and pH on lactose fermentation was 
      examined. Results have shown increase of lactose uptake rate at lower cell 
      concentrations and specifically the maximum values of lactose uptake rate were 
      obtained at 30 degrees C, 5.5 pH value and initial lactose and cell concentration 
      10% w/v and 16 g/L, respectively. Likewise, lighten that the increase of the 
      fermentation rate by immobilized cells can be attributed also, in addition to other 
      factors, to lower cell concentration on the surface of the support or of the 
      promoter. Besides, it is shown that the effect of pH value on the biochemical 
      reactions, carried out by intracellular enzymes can be attributed, except to the 
      effect of pH on enzyme ability, in addition to the effect of pH on carbohydrate 
      uptake rate.

TI  - Efficient method for the detection of microbially-produced antibacterial substances 
      from food systems.
PG  - 56-62
AB  - A novel method for the isolation of microbially-derived inhibitory substances from 
      food sources was developed. The method involves an enrichment step coupled to a 
      killing assay which is initially carried out in multiwell plates. The technique has 
      advantages in that large numbers of samples can be tested in parallel. The assay can 
      be completed in less than 60 h and is more sensitive than direct plating due to the 
      enrichment step. This novel screening approach was compared with the standard direct 
      plating approach in an effort to identify the antimicrobial potential of a number of 
      Kefir grains. Kefir grains were incubated in 10% reconstituted skim milk for 20 h at 
      32 degrees C to enable production of any potential biopreservatives. Following 
      overnight incubation, fermentates were aliquoted into multi-well plates and a known 
      number of indicator cells was added to each well. The fermentates were incubated for 
      a further 20 h and counts were carried out to determine whether a reduction in 
      indicator cell numbers had occurred. A reduction in cell-forming units indicated the 
      presence of an inhibitory substance and these inhibitory fermentates were selected 
      for further investigation. Using the protocol outlined, Kefir fermentates capable of 
      inhibiting Listeria innocua DPC1770 and Escherichia coli O157:H45 were identified.

AB  - The effect of freeze-drying on viability and probiotic properties of a microbial 
      mixture containing selected bacterial and yeast strains isolated from kefir grains 
      (Lactobacillus kefir, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae and Kluyveromyces marxianus) was studied. The microorganisms were 
      selected according to their potentially probiotic properties in vitro already 
      reported. Two types of formulations were performed, a microbial mixture (MM) 
      suspended in milk and a milk product fermented with MM (FMM). To test the effect of 
      storage on viability of microorganisms, MM and FMM were freeze-dried and maintained 
      at 4°C for six months. After 180 days of storage at 4°C, freeze-dried MM showed 
      better survival rates for each strain than freeze-dried FMM. The addition of sugars 
      (trehalose or sucrose) did not improve the survival rates of any of the 
      microorganisms after freeze-drying. Freeze-drying did not affect the capacity of MM 
      to inhibit growth of Shigella sonnei in vitro, since the co-incubation of this 
      pathogen with freeze-dried MM produced a decrease of 2 log in Shigella viability. 
      The safety of freeze-dried MM was tested in mice and non-translocation of 
      microorganisms to liver or spleen was observed in BALB/c mice feed ad libitum during 
      7 or 20 days. To our knowledge, this is the first report about the effect of 
      freeze-drying on viability, in vitro probiotic properties and microbial 
      translocation of a mixture containing different strains of both bacteria and yeasts 
      isolated from kefir.

TI  - [Immune regulation activity and mechanism of Tibetan Kefir exopolysaccharide 
      fractions].
PG  - 1660-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects and mechanism on immune regulation activity in 
      mice of two Tibetan Kefir exoploysaccharides (EPS) with different molecular weight 
      of 0.1 x 10(5) - 3 x 10(5) (fraction 1) and 1.8 x 10(3) (fraction 2). METHOD: The 
      immune regulation activity experiment was carried out in vitro based on the 
      Functional Assessment Procedure and Test Methods of Health Food, which was issued by 
      Ministry of Health of China. First, we treated mice subjects with EPS at doses of 40 
      mg/kg, 80 mg/kg, 120 mg/kg through ig. Then we detected the index of immune organs, 
      the ability of antibody production (tested by HC50), activity of NK cell, delayed 
      type hypersensitivity (DTH) and phagocytosis of macrophage in mice. Finally, we 
      examined the expression of Erk protein in Macrophages by Western Blot assay. 
      RESULTS: Fraction 1 could promote HC50, activity of NK cell and DTH in mice which 
      low dose showed better. Fraction 2 could promote DTH, phagocytosis of macrophage 
      which high dose showed better. The expression of Erk and COX-2 had the same trend 
      with Phagocytic index. CONCLUSION: We verified the two fractions of Tibetan Kefir 
      EPS could enhance immune functions in mice. Fraction 1 regulated immune function 
      through NK cell and B cell while fraction 2 through macrophage cell and T cell. The 
      effects to macrophage of Tibetan Kefir EPS in mice may realize through extra 
      cellular signal-regulated kinase Erk pathway.

AB  - Background: Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus are major causative 
      bacterial pathogens of dental caries. Objective: We investigated the applicability 
      of three Lactobacillus strains (L. kefiranofaciens DD2, DD5, and DD6) isolated from 
      kefir and three commercial Lactobacillus strains (L. plantarum ATCC 10,012, L. 
      johnsonii JCM 1022, and L. rhamnosus ATCC 7469) as potential oral probiotics with 
      respect to their survivability in an experimental oral environment, antimicrobial 
      activity, and anti-biofilm formation activity against S. mutans and S. sobrinus. 
      Results: Strains DD2, ATCC 10012, ATCC 7469, and JCM 1022 had the best oral 
      survivability, including aerotolerance and enzymatic resistance, and inhibited the 
      growth and biofilm formation of S. mutans and S. sobrinus. In particular, DD2 
      suppressed all three classes of biofilm formation-associated genes: those associated 
      with carbohydrate metabolism and those encoding regulatory biofilm and adhesion 
      proteins. Conclusions: These results indicate that the novel kefir isolate L. 
      kefiranofaciens DD2 effectively and directly inhibits S. mutans and S. sobrinus.

TI  - EFFECT OF PROBIOTIC FERMENTED MILK (KEFIR) ON SERUM LEVEL OF INSULIN AND 
      HOMOCYSTEINE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES PATIENTS.
PG  - 431-436
LID - 10.4183/aeb.2017.431 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic fermented milk is one of the most beneficial foods. The main 
      purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of probiotic fermented milk on 
      the serum level of insulin and homocysteine in the type 2 diabetes patients. 
      METHODS: This study was done in 60 patients with type 2 diabetes. The intervention 
      group received 600 mL of probiotic fermented milk (kefir) daily and control group 
      received 600 mL of conventional fermented milk daily for 8 weeks. Food intake, 
      anthropometric indices, serum parameters were assessed at the beginning and at the 
      end of the study. The statistical analysis was done by the use of SPSS software 
      (Ver.13). RESULTS: The mean of serum insulin level did not reduce significantly 
      after the intervention in probiotic fermented milk group, and there was no 
      significant difference between the two groups. The mean of HOMA-IR decreased 
      significantly in probiotic fermented milk group after intervention and there was a 
      significant difference between the two groups after intervention. The mean of 
      quickie increased in probiotic fermented milk group, but this increase was not 
      significant. Also, there was not significant difference between the two groups after 
      intervention. The mean of homocysteine level decresead significantly in patients 
      with probiotic fermented milk and conventional fermented milk consumption. 
      CONCLUSIONS: By considering the effect of probiotic fermented milk on some risk 
      factors of cardiovascular disease in diabetic patients, probiotic foods may be 
      useful as an adjuvant therapy in diabetic patients.

TI  - Microbial diversity of a Camembert-type cheese using freeze-dried Tibetan kefir 
      coculture as starter culture by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.

AB  - The biochemical changes occurring during cheese ripening are directly and indirectly 
      dependent on the microbial associations of starter cultures. Freeze-dried Tibetan 
      kefir coculture was used as a starter culture in the Camembert-type cheese 
      production for the first time. Therefore, it's necessary to elucidate the stability, 
      organization and identification of the dominant microbiota presented in the cheese. 
      Bacteria and yeasts were subjected to culture-dependent on selective media and 
      culture-independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-denaturing gradient gel 
      electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis and sequencing of dominant bands to assess the 
      microbial structure and dynamics through ripening. In further studies, kefir grains 
      were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods. A total of 147 
      bacteria and 129 yeasts were obtained from the cheese during ripening. Lactobacillus 
      paracasei represents the most commonly identified lactic acid bacteria isolates, 
      with 59 of a total of 147 isolates, followed by Lactococcus lactis (29 isolates). 
      Meanwhile, Kazachstania servazzii (51 isolates) represented the mainly identified 
      yeast isolate, followed by Saccharomyces cerevisiae (40 isolates). However, some 
      lactic acid bacteria detected by sequence analysis of DGGE bands were not recovered 
      by plating. The yeast S. cerevisiae and K. servazzii are described for the first 
      time with kefir starter culture. SEM showed that the microbiota were dominated by a 
      variety of lactobacilli (long and curved) cells growing in close association with a 
      few yeasts in the inner portion of the grain and the short lactobacilli were 
      observed along with yeast cells on the exterior portion. Results indicated that 
      conventional culture method and PCR-DGGE should be combined to describe in maximal 
      detail the microbiological composition in the cheese during ripening. The data could 
      help in the selection of appropriate commercial starters for Camembert-type cheese.

TI  - Whey valorisation: a complete and novel technology development for dairy industry 
      starter culture production.
PG  - 3734-9
LID - 10.1016/j.biortech.2009.01.058 [doi]
AB  - Whey is the major by-product of the dairy industry, produced in large quantities and 
      usually disposed off causing major environmental pollution, due to its high organic 
      load that makes treatment cost prohibitive. This paper comprises a contribution on 
      the valorisation of this high polluting liquid waste of the dairy industry, based on 
      research for the production of novel dairy starter cultures using whey as raw 
      material. Starter cultures are used for cheese ripening in order to: (i) accelerate 
      ripening, (ii) improve quality and (iii) increase shelf-life. The developed 
      technology involves biomass production from whey followed by thermal drying of 
      cultures. Specifically, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and kefir 
      yeasts were thermally dried, and their efficiency in lactose and milk whey 
      fermentations was studied. The most suitable culture regarding its technological 
      properties was kefir, which was used for cheese ripening in freeze-dried and 
      thermally dried form. Besides the reduction of production cost, which is an 
      essential requirement for the food industry, the use of thermally dried kefir 
      displayed several other advantages such as acceleration of ripening, increase of 
      shelf-life, and improvement of hard-type cheese quality.

TI  - Whey liquid waste of the dairy industry as raw material for potable alcohol 
      production by kefir granules.
PG  - 7231-4
AB  - Kefir granular biomass was used in the fermentation of sweet whey and proved to be 
      more effective compared to single-cell biomass of kefir yeast. The operational 
      stability of the biocatalyst was assessed by carrying out 20 repeated batch 
      fermentations. Levels of ethanol productivity reached 2.57 g L(-1) h(-1)), whereas 
      the yield was 0.45 g/g. The fermentation time was only 8 h. Mixtures of sweet whey 
      with molasses were fermented at initial densities ranging from 4.2 to 10.2 degrees 
      Be and resulted in ethanol yield factors between 0.36 and 0.48 g of ethanol/g of 
      utilized sugar. Lower degrees Be values led to an increase of percentages of ethyl 
      acetate on total volatiles determined and a reduction of amyl alcohols. The addition 
      of 1% black raisin extract to whey appears to promote whey fermentation, whereas the 
      same was not observed in the case of white sultana extract addition. It was finally 
      established that it is preferable to ferment mixtures of whey-molasses by adding 
      molasses in whey after the completion of whey fermentation.

TI  - Immunopotentiative effect of polysaccharide from kefir grain, KGF-C, administered 
      orally in mice.
PG  - 29-35
AB  - Since a water-soluble polysaccharide (KGF-C) from the kefir grains was shown to have 
      the property of retarding tumor growth in vivo when administered orally, the effect 
      of KGF-C was examined on antibody responses to thymus-dependent antigen, sheep red 
      blood cells (SRBC), and thymus-independent antigen, dinitrophenyl-Ficoll and 
      trinitrophenyl-lipopolysaccharide. Antibody response in mice intubated with KGF-C 
      was enhanced to low doses of SRBC, but not to optimal or high doses. The optimal 
      dose of KGF-C required for the enhancement was 100 mg/kg body weight. The 
      time-course studies on KGF-C administration implied that KGF-C exerted its effect on 
      the early events of anti-SRBC response. The enhancement was not due to the 
      alteration of kinetics of anti-SRBC responses. Furthermore, the enhancing effect on 
      antibody responses to thymus-independent antigens, such as dinitrophenyl-Ficoll and 
      trinitrophenyl-lipopolysaccharide, was observed neither in nu/nu nor in nu/+ mice, 
      and the effect on delayed-type hypersensitivity response to a low dose of SRBC in 
      normal mice was also found. These findings suggest that the oral immune enhancement 
      by KGF-C is elucidated probably through T-cell but not through B-cell participation.

AB  - Kefir grains are a unique symbiotic association of different microrganisms, mainly 
      lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and occasionally acetic acid bacteria, cohabiting in a 
      natural polysaccharide and a protein matrix. The microbial composition of kefir 
      grains can be considered as extremely variable since it is strongly influenced by 
      the geographical origin of the grains and by the sub-culturing method used. The aim 
      of this study was to elucidate the bacteria and yeast species occurring in milk 
      kefir grains collected in some Italian regions by combining the results of scanning 
      electron microscopy analysis, viable counts on selective culture media, PCR-DGGE and 
      pyrosequencing. The main bacterial species found was Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens 
      while Dekkera anomala was the predominant yeast. The presence of sub-dominant 
      species ascribed to Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis and Acetobacter 
      genera was also highlighted. In addition, Lc. lactis, Enterococcus sp., Bacillus 
      sp., Acetobacter fabarum, Acetobacter lovaniensis and Acetobacter orientalis were 
      identified as part of the cultivable community. This work further confirms both the 
      importance of combining culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches to 
      study microbial diversity in food and how the combination of multiple 16S rRNA gene 
      targets strengthens taxonomic identification using sequence-based identification 
      approaches.

AB  - The objective of this work was to test the protective effect of a mixture (MM) 
      constituted by kefir-isolated microorganisms (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus 
      kefir, Lc. lactis, Kluyveromyces marxianus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) in a 
      hamster model of infection with Clostridium difficile, an anaerobic Gram-positive 
      bacterium that causes diarrhoea. Placebo or MM was administered ad libitum in 
      drinking water from day 0 to the end of treatment. Hamsters received orally 200 μg 
      of clyndamicin at day 7 and then were infected with 1 × 10(8) CFU of C. difficile by 
      gavage. Development of diarrhoea and death was registered until the end of the 
      protocol. Surviving animals were sacrificed at day 16, and a test for biological 
      activity of clostridial toxins and histological stainings were performed in caecum 
      samples. Six of seven infected animals developed diarrhoea and 5/7 died at the end 
      of the experimental protocol. The histological sections showed oedema and 
      inflammatory infiltrates with neutrophils and crypt abscesses. In the group of 
      animals infected and treated with MM1/1000, only 1 of 7 hamsters showed diarrhoea 
      and none of them died. The histological sections showed only a slight thickening of 
      the mucosa with presence of lymphocytic infiltrate. These results demonstrate that 
      an oral treatment with a mixture of kefir-isolated bacteria and yeasts was able to 
      prevent diarrhoea and enterocolitis triggered by C. difficile.

AB  - A student-centered, interactive course-based undergraduate research experience 
      (CURE) was implemented in a microbiology course in order to provide an authentic 
      research experience and to stimulate student interest and improve understanding of 
      fermentation, probiotics, the human microbiome and related topics. Students were 
      immersed in the scientific process as they used fundamental techniques to 
      investigate the probiotic composition of a fermented milk beverage, kefir-an unknown 
      question with no predetermined outcomes. In order to assess the benefits and effect 
      of this learning experience on the students, pre- and post-study surveys were 
      administered using Qualtrics. Post-study, 93% of participants agreed that fermented 
      foods are beneficial to human health (compared to 52% pre-study), and notably, 100% 
      of participants indicated that they plan to apply this material in both their 
      personal and professional lives and would suggest consuming probiotics or fermented 
      products to alleviate gastrointestinal issues. As evidenced by demographic data, 
      this CURE is suitable for implementation at both large and small institutions with 
      diverse student populations. Collectively, these data indicate that this 
      collaborative, discovery-based learning experience is a powerful educational tool, 
      encouraging students to make real-life connections between microbiology, medicine 
      and their own health.

TI  - Co-production of functional exopolysaccharides and lactic acid by Lactobacillus 
      kefiranofaciens originated from fermented milk, kefir.
PG  - 331-340

AB  - Kefiran is a functional exopolysaccharide produced by Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens 
      originated from kefir, traditional fermented milk in the Caucasian Mountains, 
      Russia. Kefiran is attractive as thickeners, stabilizers, emulsifiers, gelling 
      agents and also has antimicrobial and antitumor activity. However, the production 
      costs of kefiran are still high mainly due to high cost of carbon and nitrogen 
      sources. This study aimed to produce kefiran and its co-product, lactic acid, from 
      low-cost industrial byproducts. Among the sources tested, whey lactose (at 2% sugar 
      concentration) and spent yeast cells hydrolysate (at 6 g-nitrogen/L) gave the 
      highest kefiran of 480 ± 21 mg/L along with lactic acid of 20.1 ± 0.2 g/L. The 
      combination of these two sources and initial pH were optimized through Response 
      Surface Methodology. With the optimized medium, L. kefiranofaciens produced more 
      kefiran and lactic acid up to 635 ± 7 mg/L and 32.9 ± 0.7 g/L, respectively. When 
      the pH was controlled to alleviate the inhibition from acidic pH, L. kefiranofaciens 
      could consume all sugars and produced kefiran and lactic acid up to 1693 ± 29 mg/L 
      and 87.49 ± 0.23 g/L, respectively. Moreover, the fed-batch fermentation with 
      intermittent adding of whey lactose improved kefiran and lactic acid productions up 
      to 2514 ± 93 mg/L and 135 ± 1.75 g/L, respectively. These results indicate the 
      promising approach to economically produce kefiran and lactic acid from low-cost 
      nutrient sources.

AB  - Fourteen homofermentative lactic acid bacteria that were isolated from kefir grains 
      and kefir fermented milks were assigned to either Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens or 
      Lactobacillus kefirgranum, based on their characteristic morphotypes, phenotypic 
      features and SDS-PAGE profiles of whole-cell proteins. Further genotypic analyses on 
      representative strains from both taxa demonstrated that L. kefiranofaciens and L. 
      kefirgranum share 100 % 16S rDNA sequence similarity and belong phylogenetically to 
      the Lactobacillus acidophilus species group. DNA-DNA binding values of >79 % and 
      analogous DNA G+C contents of 37-38 mol% showed that the strains studied belonged to 
      one species: L. kefirgranum is a later synonym of L. kefiranofaciens. An emended 
      description is proposed for L. kefiranofaciens. Due to the specific morphological 
      and biochemical characteristics of these taxa in kefir grain formation, it is 
      proposed that L. kefirgranum should be reclassified as L. kefiranofaciens subsp. 
      kefirgranum subsp. nov.

AB  - This study investigated the fortification of a carob-based kefir-like beverage (KLB) 
      with whey permeate (WP) and oat flour (OF). The response surface method was used to 
      show the effect of WP and OF concentrations on lactic acid bacteria and yeast cell 
      densities, pH, total titratable acidity (TTA), total phenolics content (TCP), DPPH 
      radical scavenging activity, and overall acceptability (OA) in KLB. The statistical 
      design provided thirteen formulations where OF concentration varied from 3% to 5% 
      and WP from 10% to 15%. The enrichment of carob pods decoction with WP and OF had a 
      positive effect on biomass production. Overall fermentation was shown to increase 
      TPC of KLB. Furthermore, OF supplementation led to the higher levels of TPC and 
      antiradical activity. WP negatively affected OA at linear and quadratic levels, 
      whereas no effect of OF was observed at the linear level. The optimum point was 
      found by using WP at 11.51% and OF at 4.77%. Optimized KLB resulted in an enrichment 
      of bioavailable phenolics derivatives and highly digestible proteins.

AB  - The activity of kefiran, the exopolysaccharide present in kefir grains, was 
      evaluated on intestinal bacterial populations in BALB/c mice. Animals were orally 
      administered with kefiran and Eubacteria, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria 
      populations were monitored in faeces of mice at days 0, 2, 7, 14 and 21. Profiles 
      obtained by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) with primers for 
      Eubacteria were compared by principal component analysis and clearly defined 
      clusters, correlating with the time of kefiran consumption, were obtained. 
      Furthermore, profile analysis of PCR products amplified with specific 
      oligonucleotides for bifidobacteria showed an increment in the number of DGGE bands 
      in the groups administered with kefiran. Fluorescent In Situ Hybridisation (FISH) 
      with specific probes for bifidobacteria showed an increment of this population in 
      faeces, in accordance to DGGE results. The bifidobacteria population was also 
      studied on distal colon content after 0, 2 and 7 days of kefiran administration. 
      Analysis of PCR products by DGGE with Eubacteria primers showed an increment in the 
      number and intensity of bands with high GC content of mice administered with 
      kefiran. Sequencing of DGGE bands confirmed that bifidobacteria were one of the 
      bacterial populations modified by kefiran administration. DGGE profiles of PCR 
      amplicons obtained by using Bifidobacterium or Lactobacillus specific primers 
      confirmed that kefiran administration enhances bifidobacteria, however no changes 
      were observed in Lactobacillus populations. The results of the analysis of 
      bifidobacteria populations assessed on different sampling sites in a murine model 
      support the use of this exopolysaccharide as a bifidogenic functional ingredient.

TI  - Lactic acid bacteria: promising supplements for enhancing the biological activities 
      of kombucha.
PG  - 91

AB  - Kombucha is sweetened black tea that is fermented by a symbiosis of bacteria and 
      yeast embedded within a cellulose membrane. It is considered a health drink in many 
      countries because it is a rich source of vitamins and may have other health 
      benefits. It has previously been reported that adding lactic acid bacteria 
      (Lactobacillus) strains to kombucha can enhance its biological functions, but in 
      that study only lactic acid bacteria isolated from kefir grains were tested. There 
      are many other natural sources of lactic acid bacteria. In this study, we examined 
      the effects of lactic acid bacteria from various fermented Vietnamese food sources 
      (pickled cabbage, kefir and kombucha) on kombucha's three main biological functions: 
      glucuronic acid production, antibacterial activity and antioxidant ability. 
      Glucuronic acid production was determined by high-performance liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry, antibacterial activity was assessed by the 
      agar-well diffusion method and antioxidant ability was evaluated by determining the 
      2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity. Four strains of 
      food-borne pathogenic bacteria were used in our antibacterial experiments: Listeria 
      monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 
      14028 and Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778. Our findings showed that lactic acid bacteria 
      strains isolated from kefir are superior to those from other sources for improving 
      glucuronic acid production and enhancing the antibacterial and antioxidant 
      activities of kombucha. This study illustrates the potential of Lactobacillus casei 
      and Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kefir as biosupplements for enhancing the 
      bioactivities of kombucha.

TI  - A Combined In Vitro and In Vivo Assessment of the Safety of the Yeast Strains 
      Kluyveromyces marxianus A4 and A5 Isolated from Korean Kefir.
LID - 10.1007/s12602-021-09872-7 [doi]
AB  - Kefir is a traditional fermented milk containing beneficial bacteria and yeasts. 
      Despite Kluyveromyces marxianus, isolated from kefir, gaining increasing attention 
      as a potential probiotic yeast owing to its biological function, Saccharomyces 
      boulardii is the only species considered as a probiotic yeast. We evaluated the 
      safety of K. marxianus strains A4 and A5, isolated from Korean kefir, in 
      comparison with that of S. boulardii. Virulence attributes were preliminarily 
      assessed in vitro including their ability of gelatin hydrolysis, pseudohyphae 
      formation, and hemolysis. To evaluate in vivo safety, the strains were challenged in 
      a healthy animal model, four-week-old female BALB/c mice. Mice were orally 
      administered 0.2 mL of 0.9% sterilized saline (NC_S; n = 6), S. boulardii ATCC 
      MYA-796 (high concentration, S.b_H; low concentration, S.b_L; n = 6 for each), K. 
      marxianus A4 (high concentration, A4_H; low concentration, A4_L; n = 6 for each), or 
      K. marxianus A5 (high concentration, A5_H; low concentration, A5_L; n = 6 for each) 
      for 2 weeks. At study end, body weight, spleen and liver weights, and blood 
      parameters were assessed. K. marxianus A4 and A5 were tested negative for gelatinase 
      and hemolysis. Overall, hematological, plasma biochemical, and cytokine 
      (interleukin-1β and tumor necrosis factor-α) parameters were comparable between the 
      experimental and negative control (NC) groups. Notably, the interleukin-6 level of 
      the A5_H group was significantly lower than that of the NC group (p < 0.05), 
      suggesting anti-inflammatory potential of K. marxianus A5.

AB  - Considering that several health promoting properties are associated with kefir 
      consumption and a reliable probiotic product requires a complete identification of 
      the bacterial species, the present work evaluates several proved markers of 
      probiotic potential of eleven isolates of homofermentative lactobacilli isolated 
      from kefir grains and molecular identification and genotypic diversity. Using 
      restriction analysis of amplified ribosomal DNA (ARDRA) and analysis of the 16S-23S 
      rRNA internal spacer region we confirmed that all homofermentative lactobacilli 
      belong to the species Lactobacillus plantarum. RAPD-PCR analysis allowed the 
      discrimination of lactobacilli in five clusters. All isolates exhibited high 
      resistance to bile salt. High survival after one hour of exposure to pH 2.5 was 
      observed in Lb. plantarum CIDCA 8313, 83210, 8327 and 8338. All isolates were 
      hydrophilic and non autoaggregative. Isolate CIDCA 8337 showed the highest 
      percentage of adhesion among strains. All tested lactobacilli had strong inhibitory 
      power against Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Seven out of eleven 
      isolates showed inhibition against Sal. enterica and five isolates were effective 
      against Sal. gallinarum. Only CIDCA 8323 and CIDCA 8327 were able to inhibit Sal. 
      sonnei. We did not find any correlation between the five clusters based on RAPD-PCR 
      and the probiotic properties, suggesting that these isolates have unique 
      characteristics.

AB  - A capsular-polysaccharide-producing strain, LM-17, was isolated from kefir grains 
      and was identified as a slime-forming, rod-shaped Lactobacillus. According to 1H- 
      and 13C-NMR spectral data, the exopolysaccharide produced by the isolated bacterial 
      strain is identical to the glucogalactan extracted from kefir grains and therefore 
      known as kefiran. The kefiran produced was characterised by means of viscosity, 
      optical rotatory power, circular dichroism and IR spectral measurements. A batch 
      procedure was set up for the culture and extraction of the exopolysaccharide in 
      laboratory conditions, resulting in a yield of 2 g/l purified kefiran from the 
      culture supernatant of the LM-17 strain.

TI  - The changes of proteins fractions shares in milk and fermented milk drinks.
PG  - 379-389

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this research was to observe the changes which take place in 
      the electrophoretic picture of milk proteins after pasteurisation and inoculation 
      with different starter cultures (both traditional and probiotic). After incubation, 
      the yoghurt, kefir, acidified milk, fermented Bifidobacterium bifidum drink and 
      Lactobacillus acidophillus drink were chilled for 14 days to observe the changes 
      which occurred. METHODS: The research materials were raw and pasteurised milk, as 
      well as fermented milk- based drinks. The raw milk used for research came from 
      Polish Holstein-Fresian black and white cows. The milk was sampled 3 times and 
      divided into 5 parts, each of which was pasteurised at 95°C for 10 min and then 
      cooled for inoculation: yoghurt to 45°C, kefir and acidified milk to 22°C and drinks 
      with Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophillus to 38°C. Milk was 
      inoculated with lyophilised, direct vat starter cultures, in an amount equal to 2% 
      of the working starter. For the production of fermented drinks, the subsequent 
      starters were applied: "YC-180" Christian Hansen for yoghurt, "D" 
      Biolacta-Texel-Rhodia for kefir, CH-N--11 Christian Hansen for acidified milk, 
      starter by Christian Hansen for the probiotic Bifidobacterium bifidum milk, starter 
      by Biolacta-Texel-Rhodia for the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophillus milk. The 
      analyses were conducted in raw, pasteurised and freshly fermented milk as well as in 
      milk drinks stored for 14 days. The total solid content was estimated by the drying 
      method; the fat content by the Gerber method; the lactose content by the Bertrand 
      method; the protein content by the Kjeldahl method with Buchi apparatus; the density 
      of milk was measured with lactodensimeter; acidity with a pH-meter; and potential 
      acidity by Soxhlet-Henkl method (AOAC, 1990). The electrophoretic separation of 
      proteins in raw and pasteurised milk, as well as in freshly produced milk drinks and 
      those stored for 14 days, was performed with SDS-PAGE (on polyacrylamid gel) basing 
      on procedure described by Laemmli (1970). RESULTS: It was shown that, in comparison 
      with raw milk, the pasteurised milk had smaller amounts of αs-, β- and κ-casein, 
      whereas the shares of γ-casein and peptides were greater, and there were no changes 
      in immunoglobulin, α-lactalbumin or β-lactoglobulin levels, which indicated that 
      hydrolysis of caseins had occurred. In all freshly fermented milk drinks, a drop in 
      αs- and β-casein was observed relative to raw milk. An increase in peptides and 
      γ-casein was also noticed (with the exception of acidified milk). There were 
      differences in α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin levels between the different 
      drinks: raw, pasteurised or freshly fermented milk. It was shown that kefir, 
      compared to the other drinks, had the lowest levels of αs- and β-casein, 
      α-lactalbumin and of peptides, as well as the highest level of γ-casein, which is 
      evidence of an increased rate of hydrolysis in that drink. It was stated that, 
      during the storage of fermented milk drinks, the levels of lactoferrin, serum 
      albumin and peptides significantly increased whereas the content of κ-casein 
      diminished. The proportions of serum albumin and lactoferrin in fermented milk 
      drinks increased relative to raw milk and/or after storage, which is evidence of 
      aggregation of proteins of low molecular mass into bigger conglomerates. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The observed differences between fermented milks, including during 
      chilled storage, in the amounts of individual proteins proves the different 
      proteolytic abilities of starter cultures used in fermented milk production. 
      α-lactoalbumin and β-lactoglobulin are, besides caseins, the most allergenic milk 
      proteins. So, kefir, because of its low α-lactoalbumin content, and Bifidobacterium 
      bifidum milk, with the lowest content of β-lactoglobulin, were the most advantageous 
      and least allergenic drinks examined.

AB  - Growth of selected microorganisms of industrial interest (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
      Kluyveromyces marxianus and kefir) by solid state fermentation (SSF) of various food 
      industry waste mixtures was studied. The fermented products were analysed for 
      protein, and nutrient minerals content, as well as for aroma volatile compounds by 
      GC/MS. The substrate fermented by K. marxianus contained the highest sum of fat and 
      protein concentration (59.2% w/w dm) and therefore it could be considered for 
      utilisation of its fat content and for livestock feed enrichment. Regarding 
      volatiles, the formation of high amounts of ε-pinene was observed only in the SSF 
      product of kefir at a yield estimated to be 4 kg/tn of SSF product. A preliminary 
      design of a biorefinery-type process flow sheet and its economic analysis, indicated 
      potential production of products (enriched livestock feed, fat and ε-pinene) of 
      significant added value.

AB  - S-layer proteins from Lactobacillus kefir and Lactobacillus brevis are able to 
      adsorb on the surface of positively charged liposomes composed by Soybean lecithin, 
      cholesterol and stearylamine. The different K values for S-layer proteins isolated 
      from L. kefir and L. brevis (4.22 x 10(-3) and 2.45 x 10(2) microM(-1) respectively) 
      indicates that the affinity of the glycosylated protein isolated from L. kefir is 
      higher than the non-glycosylated one. The attachment of S-layer proteins counteracts 
      the electrostatic charge repulsion between stearylamine molecules in the membrane 
      surface, producing an increase in the rigidity in the acyl chains as measured by DPH 
      anisotropy. Laurdan generalized polarization (GP) shows that glycosylated causes a 
      GP increase, attributed to a lowering in water penetration into the head groups of 
      membrane phospholipids, with charge density reduction, while the non-glycosylated 
      does not affect it. The octadecyl-rhodamine results indicate that S-layer coated 
      liposomes do not show spontaneous dequenching in comparison with control liposomes 
      without S-layer proteins, suggesting that S-layer protein avoid spontaneous 
      liposomal fusion. It is concluded that the increase in stability of liposomes coated 
      with S-layers proteins is due to the higher rigidity induced by the S-layer 
      attachment by electrostatic forces.

AB  - Two greatly related Lactobacillus plantarum bacteriophages (named FAGK1 and FAGK2) 
      were isolated from Kefir grains of different origins. Both phages belonged to the 
      Siphoviridae family (morphotype B1) and showed similar dimensions for head and tail 
      sizes. The host range of the two phages, using 36 strains as potential host strains, 
      differed only in the phage reactivity against one of them. The phages showed latent 
      periods of 30 min, burst periods of 80+/-10 min and burst size values of 11.0+/-1.0 
      PFU per infected cell as mean value. Identical DNA restriction patterns were 
      obtained for both phages with PvuI, SalI, HindIII and MluI. The viral DNA apparently 
      did not present extremes cos and the structural protein patterns presented four 
      major bands (32.9, 35.7, 43.0 and 66.2 kDa). This study reports the first isolation 
      of bacteriophages of Lb. plantarum from Kefir grains and adds further knowledge 
      regarding the complex microbial community of this fermented milk.

      LZ-R-5, and one strain of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LZ-R-12. The ability of 
      three strains to produce exopolysaccharide (EPS) was tested, and L. pentosus LZ-R-17 
      was found to have the highest EPS yield. One EPS (R-17-EPS) was isolated from the 
      fermented milk by L. pentosus LZ-R-17 and purified by DEAE-52 anion exchange 
      chromatography. Furthermore, R-17-EPS preliminary structure and macrophage 
      immunomodulatory activity in vitro were investigated. On the basis of the analytical 
      results of ultraviolet-visible spectrum, Fourier transform-infrared spectrum, 
      monosaccharide composition analysis and one-dimensional and two-dimensional nuclear 
      magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, R-17-EPS was found to have an average molecular 
      weight of 1.20 × 10(6) Da and was composed of galactose and glucose residues with a 
      molar ratio of 1.00:3.15. NMR analysis revealed that the R-17-EPS was a linear 
      hetero-galactoglucan containing repeating units of 
      →2)-α-D-Galp-(1 → 4)-β-D-Glcp-(1 → 4)-β-D-Glcp-(1 → 4)-β-D-Glcp-(1→. In addition, 
      R-17-EPS could effectively enhanced the proliferation, phagocytosis, nitric oxide 
      and cytokines production of RAW264.7 cells, suggesting that R-17-EPS had potent 
      immunostimulatory activity and could be explored as immunomodulator in functional 
      food and/or medicine fields.

TI  - Application of A Novel Potential Probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei Strain Isolated 
      from Kefir Grains in the Production of Feta-Type Cheese.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms6040121 [doi]
LID - 121
AB  - In the present study 38 lactic acid bacteria strains were isolated from kefir grains 
      and were monitored regarding probiotic properties in a series of established in 
      vitro tests, including resistance to low pH, resistance to pepsin and pancreatin, 
      and tolerance to bile salts, as well as susceptibility against common antibiotics. 
      Among them, the strain SP3 displayed potential probiotic properties. Multiplex PCR 
      analysis indicated that the novel strain belongs to the paracasei species. Likewise, 
      the novel strain (Lactobacillus paracasei SP3) was applied as a starter culture for 
      Feta-type cheese production. Feta-type cheese production resulted in significantly 
      higher acidity; lower pH; reduced counts of coliforms, yeasts and fungi; and 
      improved quality characteristics compared with cheese samples produced with no 
      starter culture. Finally, it is highlighted that the application of the novel strain 
      led to Feta-type cheese production with improved overall quality and sensory 
      characteristics.

AB  - The current investigation reveals new findings concerning the substantial 
      promotional activity of orange juice, orange peel and molasses on whey fermentation 
      using single cell culture of kefir microflora. Specifically, the addition in whey of 
      only 1 % v/v orange juice or 1% v/v molasses - 4% w/v orange peel reduced the 
      fermentation time to 10 from 70 hours. But the lowest fermentation time (9 h) was 
      observed when a composite biocatalyst consisted of cells entrapped with orange peel 
      in corn starch gel was used, where also the highest (14)C-labeled lactose uptake 
      rate by kefir was recorded. Bio-ethanol concentrations were increased using all the 
      aforementioned promoters too and volatile byproducts such as esters were raised 
      during the whey-orange juice mixtures fermentations, while terpenes by composite 
      biocatalyst. The findings could be the base for new research projects for the rapid 
      production of novel food stuffs and chemicals using whey as raw material.

TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kefir protects vero cells from cytotoxicity by 
      type-II shiga toxin from Escherichia coli O157:H7.
PG  - 64-71
LID - 10.1017/S0022029912000659 [doi]
AB  - Kefir is a fermented-milk beverage originating and widely consumed in the Caucasus 
      as well as in Eastern Europe and is a source of bacteria with potential probiotic 
      properties. Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli producing Shiga toxin is commonly 
      associated with food-transmitted diseases; the most prevalent serotype causing 
      epidemics is Esch. coli O157:H7. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      antagonism of Lactobacillus plantarum isolated from kefir against the action on Vero 
      cells of supernatants of the Esch. coli O157:H7 strain 69160 expressing the type-II 
      Shiga toxin (Stx2) and to study the role of the Lactobacillus cell wall in that 
      inhibition. Spent culture supernatants of Esch. coli O157:H7 strain 69160 led to 
      cytotoxic effects on cultured eukaryotic cells as evidenced by the 
      3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-bromide-cleavage assay or by 
      lactate-dehyrogenase release. Lb. plantarum CIDCA 83114 reduced the cytotoxic 
      activity of Stx present in strain-69160 supernatants, and this protection was 
      markedly higher than those of Lactobacillus kefir CIDCA 83113 and 8348 and Lb. 
      delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus CIDCA 333. This antagonism of cytotoxicity was 
      mimicked by Lb. plantarum cell walls but was reduced after heating or protease 
      treatments, thus indicating a protein or peptide as being involved in the protection 
      mechanism. The cell surface of the lactobacilli bound the subunit B of Stx thereby 
      decreasing the cytotoxicity. These interactions could constitute the first step in 
      preventing the damage induced by Esch. coli O157:H7 supernatants, thus representing 
      a valuable means of potentially mitigating the noxious effects of this food 
      pathogen.

AB  - This study proposed a novel analytical method for the separation and determination 
      of cobalamin and cobalt in kefir samples by high performance liquid 
      chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry 
      (HPLC-ICP-OES) in addition to determination of cobalamin in HPLC system. 
      Chromatographic parameters such as column type, buffer solution, mobile phase flow 
      rate and sample injection volume were individually studied and optimized. In 
      addition, cobalamin was simultaneously determined by high performance liquid 
      chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). LOD values of cobalt in 
      cobalamin and cobalt for HPLC-ICP-OES system were calculated as 0.07 mg/kg (as Co) 
      and 0.06 mg/kg, respectively. Recovery studies were conducted to evaluate the 
      accuracy/applicability of the method. Recovery results for cobalt in cobalamin and 
      cobalt detected by the HPLC-ICP-OES system were calculated in the range of 
      87.4-100.1 and 98.8-115.0%, respectively while recovery results for cobalamin were 
      found to be between 89.2 and 98.3% for HPLC-UV system.

      system for production of useful substances.
PG  - 35-62
AB  - Co-culture systems containing two microorganisms for the production of useful 
      substances are described. We developed a novel co-culture system composed of two 
      fermentors and two microfiltration modules. The proposed co-culture system allowed 
      regulation of the dissolved oxygen concentration at a level suitable for an 
      individual microorganism in each fermentor, as well as the successful exchange of 
      culture medium between two fermentors. By co-culture, using a combination of Pichia 
      stipitis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, ethanol was produced efficiently from a 
      mixture of glucose and xylose. Moreover, the useful probiotic cells were 
      simultaneously produced with a high productivity by our co-culture using a 
      combination of Bifidobacterium and Propionibacterium. Kefiran production by 
      Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens alone under the culture conditions, established by 
      mimicking the presence and activities of yeast cells in kefir grains, was also 
      investigated. The results obtained showed that under the culture conditions 
      established by mimicking the actions of yeast cells on L. kefiranofaciens in kefir 
      grains, the amount of kefiran produced was enhanced, even when the lactic acid 
      bacterium alone was used.

AB  - The effects of parental behaviors, attitudes, and drug-use as perceived by 
      adolescents on the latter's attitudes toward and intent to use psychoactive 
      substances were studied. Perceived parental rejection, acceptance, and attitudes 
      significantly differentiated between adolescents who reported favorable attitudes 
      toward and high intent to use substances and those who expressed less favorable 
      attitudes. On most parameters, the father's influence was significant, whereas the 
      effect of the mother did not reach significance. Positive and significant 
      relationships were also found between perceived parental rejection, acceptance, and 
      attitudes and adolescent attitudes and intent to use psychoactive substances. No 
      relationships were found between controlling parental behavior and adolescent 
      attitudes and intent to use psychoactive substances. The role of the parents, as 
      well as implications of the findings for prevention are discussed.

TI  - Antitumor activity in mice of orally administered polysaccharide from Kefir grain.
PG  - 75-80
AB  - The antitumor activity of a water-soluble polysaccharide (KGF-C), isolated from the 
      Kefir grain, was studied in the mice subcutaneously inoculated with Ehrlich 
      carcinoma (EC) or Sarcoma 180 (S-180). The growth of EC and S-180 solid tumor was 
      inhibited by 40-59% and 21-81%, respectively, by oral administration of KGF-C as 
      compared with the unadministered mice. The tumor growth was similarly inhibited by 
      intraperitoneal administration. The mechanism of the antitumor activity of KGF-C was 
      considered to be host-mediated because of the lack of direct in vitro effect on 
      tumor cells.

TI  - Novel Functional Whey-Based Drinks with Great Potential in the Dairy Industry.
PG  - 307-314
AB  - This work focuses on the production of liquid whey protein concentrates by 
      ultrafiltration followed by thermal denaturation and homogenization of the 
      ultrafiltrated concentrate, as well as on the production of ultrafiltrated permeates 
      concentrated by reverse osmosis. Kefir grains (fresh and thawed) and/or commercial 
      probiotic bacteria were inoculated in both liquid whey protein concentrates and 
      concentrated ultrafiltrated permeates and grown at 25 °C for 24 h for the 
      manufacture of fermented drinks. The physicochemical characterization (pH, 
      titratable acidity, viscosity, and content of total solids, ash, fat and proteins) 
      of the obtained drinks was then assessed and compared. Enumeration of viable 
      microorganisms was carried out immediately after inoculation (at 0 h), during the 
      fermentation period (at 12 and 24 h) and during refrigerated storage (at 48, 168 and 
      336 h). The fermented drinks showed acceptable physicochemical and sensorial 
      properties, and contained above 7 log CFU/mL of lactococci and lactobacilli and 6 
      log CFU/mL of yeasts after 14 days of refrigerated storage, which is in agreement 
      with the standards required by international organizations like European Food Safety 
      Authority (EFSA) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for products containing 
      probiotics. In summary, the strategy developed in this work contributes to the 
      expansion of the applications of products derived from whey fractionation for the 
      design of novel functional foods.

AB  - A total of 34 lactic acid bacteria isolates from 4 different Brazilian kefir grains 
      were identified and characterized among a group of 150 isolates, using the ability 
      to tolerate acidic pH and resistance to bile salts as restrictive criteria for 
      probiotic potential. All isolates were identified by amplified ribosomal DNA 
      restriction analysis and 16S rDNA sequencing of representative amplicons. Eighteen 
      isolates belonged to the species Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 11 to Lactococcus lactis 
      (of which 8 belonged to subspecies cremoris and 3 to subspecies lactis), and 5 to 
      Lactobacillus paracasei. To exclude replicates, a molecular typing analysis was 
      performed by combining repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR and random 
      amplification of polymorphic DNA techniques. Considering a threshold of 90% 
      similarity, 32 different strains were considered. All strains showed some 
      antagonistic activity against 4 model food pathogens. In addition, 3 Lc. lactis 
      strains and 1 Lb. paracasei produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances against 
      at least 2 indicator organisms. Moreover, 1 Lc. lactis and 2 Lb. paracasei presented 
      good total antioxidative activity. None of these strains showed undesirable 
      enzymatic or hemolytic activities, while proving susceptible or intrinsically 
      resistant to a series of clinically relevant antibiotics. The Lb. paracasei strain 
      MRS59 showed a level of adhesion to human Caco-2 epithelial cells comparable with 
      that observed for Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. Taken together, these properties allow 
      the MRS59 strain to be considered a promising probiotic candidate.

AB  - AIMS: To set-up an experimental and analytical methodology to evaluate the 
      feasibility of developing simple, accurate and quantitative models based on Raman 
      spectroscopy and multivariate analysis for the quantification of metal ions adsorbed 
      to the bacterial surface of Lactobacillus kefir. METHODS AND RESULTS: One millilitre 
      cultures from two strains of Lact. kefir in the stationary phase were harvested and 
      washed twice with ultra pure water. The bacterial pellets were resuspended into 1 ml 
      solutions of Pb(+2), Cd(+2) or Ni(+2) ranging from 0 to 0·9 mmol l(-1). The 
      suspensions were further incubated for 1 h at 30°C at pH 5·5. After centrifugation, 
      the pellets were kept to register the Raman spectra and the supernatants were used 
      for the analytical determination of Pb(+2) , Cd(+2) and Ni(+2). Micro-organisms 
      nontreated with metal ions were used as controls. Principal component analysis (PCA) 
      was performed over the preprocessed Raman spectra to evaluate whether the clusters 
      obtained could be correlated with the concentration of metal ions attached to the 
      bacterial biomass. After that, partial least squares (PLS) models were calibrated 
      with the aim of quantifying the metal ions adsorbed to the bacterial surface. 
      According to the analytical determinations, the maximum binding capacity of all the 
      metals (q(max)) attained values that are comparable with those observed for other 
      lactic acid bacteria (ca. 0·200 mmol g(-1)). The spectral analysis revealed that the 
      main functional groups involved in the bacteria/metal interaction are carboxylates, 
      phosphates and polysaccharides. In PCA, the first two principal components explain 
      more than 72% variance of the spectral data set contained in the data structure, 
      allowing a clear discrimination among samples of different concentrations. Based on 
      this information and using as reference the results obtained by analytical methods, 
      PLS prediction models were successfully defined for the quantification of Pb(+2), 
      Cd(+2) and Ni(+2) attached to the bacterial surface. CONCLUSIONS: The calibration 
      and validation of methods based on multivariate analysis allowed the definition of 
      models for the quantification of Pb(+2), Cd(+2) and Ni(+2) attached to bacterial 
      surfaces. The high percentages of explained variances in PCA gave a strong support 
      to calibrate the prediction models, depicting very good correlations with the 
      reference method (correlations ∼0·90 in all cases). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE 
      STUDY: Lactobacillus kefir CIDCA 8348 and JCM 5818 bind Pb(+2), Cd(+2) and Ni(+2) in 
      an efficient way. This fact gives support for their potential use as sequestrants of 
      traces of these metals in products addressed to human and animal consume. The 
      prediction models developed would be useful for the determination of the 
      investigated metal ions in unknown samples giving at the same time, structural 
      information about this interaction. This is certainly the most important 
      contribution of this work.

PG  - 14-7
AB  - The microflora of the small and large intestines was studied in 105 patients with 
      chronic enteritis. Significant amounts of various microorganisms were detected in 
      the small intestine. The content of E. coli, bacteroids, bifidobacteria in feces 
      diminished, while that of staphylococcus, enterococcus and fungi rose. The patients 
      were given diet N 4 (intended for enteritis patients) containing lactic acid 
      products (200 ml, 5 times/day, during 24 days); 38 patients received shubat, 
      30--koumiss and 37--kefir. Koumiss proved to be most effective in the treatment of 
      intestinal dysbacteriosis. Shubat possessed a lower antibiotic activity. Kefir 
      administration did not produce significant shifts in the intestinal microflora. 
      Lactic acid products were ineffective in fungous and Proteus dysbacteriosis. Koumiss 
      and shubat could be recommended for the therapy of certain types of intestinal 
      dysbacteriosis, thus restricting the use of antibacterial drugs.

      Functional Dairy Food Applications.

AB  - Isolation and functional characterization of microorganisms are relevant steps for 
      generating starter cultures with functional properties, and more recently, those 
      related to improving mental health. Milk kefir grains have been recently 
      investigated as a source of health-related strains. This study focused on the 
      evaluation of microorganisms from artisanal Mexican milk kefir grains regarding 
      probiotic properties, in vitro fermentability with commercial prebiotics (lactulose, 
      inulin, and citrus pectin), and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-producing capacity. 
      Microorganisms were identified belonging to genera Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, 
      Leuconostoc, and Kluyveromyces. The probiotic properties were assessed by 
      aggregation abilities, antimicrobial activity, antibiotic susceptibility, and 
      resistance to in vitro gastrointestinal digestion, showing a good performance 
      compared with commercial probiotics. Most of isolates maintained a concentration 
      above 6 log colony forming units/mL after the intestinal phase. Specific isolates of 
      Kluyveromyces (BIOTEC009 and BIOTEC010), Leuconostoc (BIOTEC011 and BIOTEC012), and 
      Lactobacillus (BIOTEC014 and BIOTEC15) showed a high fermentability in media 
      supplemented with commercial prebiotics. The capacity to produce GABA was classified 
      as medium for L. lactis BIOTEC006, BIOTEC007, and BIOTEC008; K. lactis BIOTEC009; L. 
      pseudomesenteroides BIOTEC012; and L. kefiri BIOTEC014, and comparable to that 
      obtained for commercial probiotics. Finally, a multivariate approach was performed, 
      allowing the grouping of 2-5 clusters of microorganisms that could be further 
      considered new promising cultures for functional dairy food applications.

AB  - Arthritis is a disorder that is characterized by joint inflammation and other 
      symptoms. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), an autoimmune disease, is one of the most 
      common arthritis in worldwide. Inflammation of the synovium is the main factor that 
      triggers bone erosion in the joints in RA, but the pathogenesis of RA is not clearly 
      understood. Kefir grain-fermented products have been demonstrated to enhance immune 
      function and exhibit immune-modulating bioactivities. This study aims to explore the 
      role of kefir peptides (KPs) on the regulation of dendritic cell, which are found in 
      RA synovial fluid, and the protection effects of KPs on mice with collagen-induced 
      arthritis (CIA). Immature mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) were 
      treated with KPs (2.2 and 4.4 mg/ml) and then exposed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to 
      study the immune regulation function of KPs in dendritic cells. Mice with CIA (n = 5 
      per group) were orally administrated KPs (3.75 and 7.5 mg/day/kg) for 21 days and 
      therapeutic effect of KPs on mice with arthritis were assessed. In this study, we 
      found that KPs could inhibit surface molecule expression, reduce inflammatory 
      cytokine release, and repress NF-κB and MAPK signaling in LPS-stimulated mouse 
      BMDCs. In addition, a high dose of KPs (7.5 mg/kg) significantly alleviated 
      arthritis symptoms, decreased inflammatory cytokine expression, suppressed splenic 
      DC maturation and decrease the percentage of Th1 and Th17 in the spleens on mice 
      with CIA. Our findings demonstrated that KPs ameliorate CIA in mice through the 
      mechanism of suppressing DC maturation and inflammatory cytokine releases.

TI  - Symbiosis between microorganisms from kombucha and kefir: Potential significance to 
      the enhancement of kombucha function.

AB  - Gluconacetobacter sp. A4 (G. sp. A4), which had strong ability to produce 
      d-saccharic acid 1, 4 lactone (DSL), was the key functional bacteria isolated from 
      the kombucha preserved. This paper investigated the interaction between G. sp. A4 
      and ten different strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) obtained from kefir. The 
      result suggested that the LAB promoted DSL production of G. sp. A4 to different 
      extents, ranging from 4.86% to 86.70%. Symbiosis between G. sp. A4 and LAB was 
      studied. LAB's metabolites, xylitol, and acetic acid, were utilized by G. sp. A4, 
      and it promoted the growth of G. sp. A4 and yield of DSL. Therefore, in developing 
      starter cultures for kombucha fermentation process, a mixed flora of LAB and G. sp. 
      A4 would be the optimal combination.

AB  - The aim of the work was to study the association of overweight and obesity with the 
      consumption of basic types of dairy products among the adult population of Russia. 
      Data from the survey of the diet of adult members of 45,000 households, conducted in 
      2013 by the Federal Service of State Statistics in all regions of the country, have 
      been used. The actual consumption of food among all members of the surveyed 
      households was studied by 24-hour (daily) diet recall in April and September 2013. 
      The body mass index was calculated on the basis of self-esteem by respondents of 
      body weight and height. It was shown that average daily intake of kefir, yogurt and 
      cottage cheese was higher in women, while consumption of drinking milk and cheeses 
      was higher for men. Consumption of drinking milk and kefir in men and women was much 
      higher in groups with overweight and obesity than with normal body weight. 
      Consumption of yogurt, on the contrary, was much less in people of both sexes with 
      overweight and obesity. Consumption of milk, kefir and cottage cheese increased with 
      age, while consumption of yogurt and cheeses, on the contrary, decreased with age. 
      The data of the variation statistics indicated the existence of a relationship 
      between obesity and consumption of individual dairy products. However, the 
      dependence of these same parameters on age reduced the reliability and evidentiary 
      strength of the results of the variation analysis, since the prevalence of obesity 
      increases significantly with age. To study the association of dairy consumption and 
      the spread of obesity, a logistic regression model was used with the calculation of 
      the odd ratio of the risk of obesity in the consumption of dairy products with 
      adjustment for age, education level and per capita family income. The results of the 
      association analysis, with adjustment for socio-demographic variables, unambiguously 
      showed a significant reduction in the risk of obesity in persons of both sexes 
      consuming yoghurt (OR mean 0.76; CI 0.71; 0.82; р<0.001), cottage cheese (OR mean 
      0.88; CI 0.85; 0.91; р<0.001), as well as in women with consumption of drinking milk 
      (OR mean 0.87; CI 0.84; 0.91; р<0.001). The increase in the risk of obesity was 
      observed only in men with consuming kefir (OR mean 1.08; CI 1.01; 1.16; р=0.023) or 
      hard cheeses (OR mean 1.14; CI 1.08; 1.20; р<0.001) with adjustment for 
      socio-demographic variables.

AB  - The rise of antibiotic resistance has increased the need for alternative ways of 
      preventing and treating enteropathogenic bacterial infection. Various probiotic 
      bacteria have been used in animal and human. However, Saccharomyces boulardii is the 
      only yeast currently used in humans as probiotic. There is scarce research conducted 
      on yeast species commonly found in kefir despite its claimed potential preventative 
      and curative effects. This work focused on adhesion properties, and antibacterial 
      metabolites produced by Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces unisporus isolated 
      from traditional kefir grains compared to Saccharomyces boulardii strains. Adhesion 
      and sedimentation assay, slide agglutination, microscopy and turbidimetry assay were 
      used to analyze adhesion of Salmonella Arizonae and Salmonella Typhimurium onto 
      yeast cells. Salmonella growth inhibition due to the antimicrobial metabolites 
      produced by yeasts in killer toxin medium was analyzed by slab on the lawn, 
      turbidimetry, tube dilution and solid agar plating assays. Alcohol and antimicrobial 
      proteins production by yeasts in killer toxin medium were analyzed using gas 
      chromatography and shotgun proteomics, respectively. Salmonella adhered onto viable 
      and non-viable yeast isolates cell wall. Adhesion was visualized using scanning 
      electron microscope. Yeasts-fermented killer toxin medium showed Salmonella growth 
      inhibition. The highest alcohol concentration detected was 1.55%, and proteins with 
      known antimicrobial properties including cathelicidin, xanthine dehydrogenase, 
      mucin-1, lactadherin, lactoperoxidase, serum amyloid A protein and lactotransferrin 
      were detected in yeasts fermented killer medium. These proteins are suggested to be 
      responsible for the observed growth inhibition effect of yeasts-fermented killer 
      toxin medium. Kluyveromyces lactis and Saccharomyces unisporus have anti-salmonella 
      effect comparable to Saccharomyces boulardii strains, and therefore have potential 
      to control Salmonella infection.

AB  - There is a strong public concern about plastic waste, which promotes the development 
      of new biobased materials. The benefit of using microbial biomass for new 
      developments is that it is a completely renewable source of polymers, which is not 
      limited to climate conditions or may cause deforestation, as biopolymers come from 
      vegetal biomass. The present review is focused on the use of microbial biomass and 
      its derivatives as sources of biopolymers to form new materials. Yeast and fungal 
      biomass are low-cost and abundant sources of biopolymers with high promising 
      properties for the development of biodegradable materials, while milk and water 
      kefir grains, composed by kefiran and dextran, respectively, produce films with very 
      good optical and mechanical properties. The reasons for considering microbial 
      cellulose as an attractive biobased material are the conformational structure and 
      enhanced properties compared to plant cellulose. Kombucha tea, a probiotic fermented 
      sparkling beverage, produces a floating membrane that has been identified as 
      bacterial cellulose as a side stream during this fermentation. The results shown in 
      this review demonstrated the good performance of microbial biomass to form new 
      materials, with enhanced functional properties for different applications.

TI  - [A new oxidase method for analyzing L-lactate].
PG  - 134-9
AB  - A new oxidase-coupled colorimetric method for analysis of L-lactate in biological 
      fluids has been developed without use of peroxidase. The method is based on lactate 
      oxidase-catalysed transformation of lactate to pyruvate which is determined 
      photometrically in the next dye-producing reaction of 3-methyl-2-benzothiazolinone 
      hydrazone (MBTH) in the presence of ferric ions. Sensitivity of the method is 
      estimated as 0.1 micromole of analyte in 4-ml of reaction mixture. Linearity is 
      observed in the range 0.1-1.0 micromole of L-lactate in sample (r = 0.99943; p < 
      0.0001). The developed method has been adapted for assay of L-lactic acid in kefirs 
      and yogurts.

      temperature on kinetic parameters, in the range of 5-30 degrees C, was examined. At 
      pH 4.7 the shortest fermentation time was obtained. The formation of volatiles 
      indicates that the concentration of amyl alcohols (total content of 
      2-methylbutanol-1 and 3-methylbutanol-1) is reduced as the temperature becomes 
      lower. Propanol-1 and isobutyl alcohol formation drops significantly below 15 
      degrees C. The percentage of ethyl acetate increases as the temperature is 
      diminished. At 5 degrees C the content of total volatiles in the product was only 
      38% of the volatiles formed during fermentation at 30 degrees C.

AB  - Selenium content of 1028 milk and milk products of Turkey are presented in this 
      study. The selenium content of human milk (colostrum, transitional, and mature 
      milk), various kinds of milk [cow, sheep, goat, buffalo, paper boxes (3%, 1.5%, 
      0.012% fat), bottled milk, condensed milk (10% fat), mineral added milk (1.6%), and 
      banana, strawberry, and chocolate milk] and milk products (kefir, yogurt, Ayran, 
      various cheese, coffee cream, ice cream, butter, margarine, milk powder, and fruit 
      yogurt) in Turkey were determined by a spectrofluorometric method. The selenium 
      levels of cow milks collected from 57 cities in Turkey were also determined. 
      Selenium levels in cow milk varied with geographical location in Turkey and were 
      found to be lowest for Van and highest for Aksaray. The results [milk (cow, sheep, 
      goat, buffalo and human) and milks products] were compared with literature data from 
      different countries.

TI  - Lactobacilli isolated from sugary kefir grains capable of polysaccharide production 
      and minicell formation.
PG  - 311-20
AB  - Homo- and heterofermentative species of Lactobacillus have been isolated from sugary 
      kefir grains. Most of the homofermentative strains fermented tagatose and aldonitol 
      and presented 48-54% of homology with Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei NCDO 
      151 (ex Lactobacillus casei). The two variants of a hetero-fermentative species, 
      although fermenting arabinose, were related to Lactobacillus hilgardii NCDO 264 
      (type strain) with 88% of homology. One of them produced polysaccharide from sucrose 
      at pH 4.8 and 30 degrees C; the best glucose conversion into polysaccharide was 
      obtained from 3% of sucrose (81.8%), and the maximum production occurred about 35 
      hours after the end of the log phase of growth, in MRS sucrose broth. Polysaccharide 
      formation did not occur above 40 degrees C, a temperature at which no growth was 
      observed. The two variants were forming minicells by abnormal divisions.

AB  - Four samples of Tibetan kefir grains (TK-ZJUJ 01-04) from Tibet and surrounding 
      areas were investigated via phenotypic and genotypic methods to compare and analyze 
      the diversity of culturable microflora among different origins. As a result, 4 
      genera of microorganisms from TK-ZJUJ01: Bacillus subtilis (2.9 × 10(7) cfu/mL), 
      Lactococcus lactis (8.2 × 10(7) cfu/mL), Kluyveromyces marxianus (3.0 × 10(6) 
      cfu/mL), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (9.0 × 10(6) cfu/mL); 4 genera from TK-ZJUJ02: 
      Lactobacillus kefiri (1.0 × 10(8) cfu/mL), Pichia kudriavzevii (5.0 × 10(6) cfu/mL), 
      K. marxianus (1.9 × 10(7) cfu/mL), Kazachstania unispora (6.2 × 10(7) cfu/mL); 6 
      genera from TK-ZJUJ03: Leuconostoc lactis (4.6 × 10(7) cfu/mL), L. lactis (3.0 × 
      10(7) cfu/mL), Lactobacillus plantarum (3.0 × 10(7) cfu/mL), K. unispora (3.0 × 
      10(6) cfu/mL), K. marxianus (2.0 × 10(6) cfu/mL), (1.7 × 10(7) cfu/mL); and 4 genera 
      from TK-ZJUJ04: L. plantarum (1.8 × 10(7) cfu/mL), Acetobacter fabarum (5.0 × 10(6) 
      cfu/mL), K. unispora (6.2 × 10(7) cfu/mL), Pichia guilliermondii (6.2 × 10(7) 
      cfu/mL) were identified. Yeasts like P. kudriavzevii and P. guilliermondii isolated 
      in this study were the first time reported in Tibetan kefir grains. For TK-ZJUJ 
      01-03, lactic acid bacteria were the major microorganisms, which accounted for more 
      than 50% of all the microbial population, while for TK-ZJUJ04, the largest microbial 
      group was yeasts which accounted for more than 50%. In a word, study of diversity 
      and composition of microflora provided us theoretical foundation for further 
      investigation and application of Tibetan kefir grains. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: This 
      is the basic research in order to develop and industrialize a new kind of yogurt 
      starter which is naturally formed microbiota with both lactic acid bacteria and 
      yeasts in it.

AB  - Fibre type percentage and changes in textural parameters, sensory properties as well 
      as mean fibre cross sectional area (CSA), fibre shape, endomysium and perimysium 
      thickness of wild boar and deer longissimus (L) muscle subjected to ageing with 
      kefir, dry red wine, lemon and pineapple juice marinades for 4 days were studied. 
      Among the non-marinated and non-aged samples of muscles it was found that wild boar 
      meat with its higher percentage of red fibres, higher CSA, thicker connective tissue 
      as compared with deer meat, was harder, more springy and stringy. Muscles ageing, 
      regardless of methods, resulted in a decrease in both the CSA and thickness of the 
      connective tissue, and improve in fibre shape. As a consequence ageing caused a 
      reduction in hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, and stringiness as well as in 
      augmentation of tenderness, juiciness and general attractiveness of the muscles 
      studied. As demonstrated by obtained data, regardless of ageing methods, deer L 
      muscle contained more white fibres compared to wild boar muscle, were more 
      susceptible to tenderization. The highest structural and textural changes, but the 
      worst general attractiveness was found in muscles marinated with pineapple juice 
      addition. Insignificantly lower changes in both quality traits were found in muscles 
      aged with kefir marinade which at the same time were characterized by the high 
      tenderness, the highest juiciness and general attractiveness.

TI  - Lactobacilli isolated from kefir grains: evidence of the presence of S-layer 
      proteins.
PG  - 222-30
AB  - In the present study we report for the first time the presence of S-layer proteins 
      in Lactobacillus kefir and Lactobacillus parakefir isolated from kefir grains. 
      Soluble whole-cell protein profile obtained either by mechanical disruption 
      (X-press) or by a combined treatment with lysozyme and SDS on whole cells, showed a 
      significant band of apparent molecular mass of 66-71 kDa as measured by SDS-PAGE. 
      The intensity of this band was considerably reduced when cells were treated with 5 
      M-LiCl. The above mentioned proteins were recovered in the LiCl extracts. After 
      dialysis and concentration, the proteins extracted were able to reassemble in a 
      regular array. Negative staining of these protein preparations were analysed by 
      transmission electron microscopy and a paracrystalline arrangement was seen. Thin 
      sections of bacteria analysed by transmission electron micrographs showed an 
      outermost layer over the bacterial cell wall, that was lost after the LiCl 
      treatment. The production of this surface structure under different culture 
      conditions was also evaluated. Finally, the relationship between the presence of 
      S-layer proteins and surface properties (e.g. adhesion to Caco-2 cells, 
      autoaggregation, and hemagglutination) was investigated.

AB  - The light harvesting photosystem in cyanobacteria offers a potential pathway for the 
      regeneration of the nicotinamide cofactor NADPH, thereby facilitating the 
      application of cyanobacteria as excellent whole cell biocatalysts in 
      oxidoreductase-mediated biotransformation. The use of cyanobacterial metabolism for 
      cofactor recycling improves the atom economy of the process compared to the commonly 
      employed enzyme-coupled cofactor recycling using enzymes such as glucose 
      dehydrogenase. Here we report the asymmetric conversion of acetophenone to chiral 
      1-phenylethanol by recombinant Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 whole cell 
      biocatalyst that expresses the NADPH dependent L. kefir alcohol dehydrogenase. 
      Besides light, it was observed that carbon dioxide levels play a critical role in 
      improving the bioconversion efficiency possibly due to the enhanced growth rate and 
      improved cofactor availability at elevated CO(2) levels. Complete reduction of 
      acetophenone to optically pure (R)-1-phenylethanol at 99% enantiomeric excess was 
      achieved within 6 h with a relatively low cell density of 0.66 g/l by coupling 
      optimum light and CO(2) levels and without the need for a co-substrate.

TI  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens M1 isolated from milk kefir grains ameliorates 
      experimental colitis in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 63-74

AB  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens M1, isolated from and identified in Taiwanese milk 
      kefir grain, has demonstrated immune-modulating activity. In the present study, we 
      further investigated the effects of Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 on intestinal epithelial 
      cells in vitro and on dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in vivo. The 
      possible mechanisms regarding the cytokine products and intestinal epithelial 
      barrier restoration as well as the putative receptor for the protective effects of 
      Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 were investigated. In vitro results indicated that Lb. 
      kefiranofaciens M1 could strengthen the epithelial barrier function in vitro by 
      increasing the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and significantly 
      upregulated the level of the chemokine CCL-20 at both the apical and basolateral 
      sites. The in vivo effects of Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 on the regulation of intestinal 
      physiology indicate that this strain could ameliorate DSS-induced colitis with a 
      significant attenuation of the bleeding score and colon length shortening. 
      Production of proinflammatory cytokines was decreased and that of the 
      antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 was increased in the DSS-treated mice given Lb. 
      kefiranofaciens M1. The putative receptor for the protective effects of Lb. 
      kefiranofaciens M1 was toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which was involved in 
      probiotic-induced cytokine production in vitro and in attenuation of the bleeding 
      score and colon length shortening in vivo. In this study, the kefir lactobacillus 
      Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 clearly demonstrated an anticolitis effect. Based on these 
      results, Lb. kefiranofaciens M1 has the potential to be applied in fermented dairy 
      products as an alternative therapy for intestinal disorders.

AB  - A novel Bifidobacterium, strain LMG 28769(T), was isolated from a household water 
      kefir fermentation process. Cells were Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, 
      non-spore-forming, catalase-negative, oxidase-negative and facultatively anaerobic 
      short rods. Analysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed Bifidobacterium 
      crudilactis and Bifidobacterium psychraerophilum (97.4 and 97.1 % similarity towards 
      the respective type strain sequences) as nearest phylogenetic neighbours. Its 
      assignment to the genus Bifidobacterium was confirmed by the presence of fructose 
      6-phosphate phosphoketolase activity. Analysis of the hsp60 gene sequence revealed 
      very low similarity with nucleotide sequences in the NCBI nucleotide database. The 
      genotypic and phenotypic analyses allowed the differentiation of strain LMG 28769(T) 
      from all recognized Bifidobacterium species. Strain LMG 28769(T) ( = CCUG 
      67145(T) = R 54638(T)) therefore represents a novel species, for which the name 
      Bifidobacterium aquikefiri sp. nov. is proposed.

TI  - Asymmetric synthesis of tert-butyl (3R, 5S) 6-chloro-dihydroxyhexanoate with 
      Lactobacillus kefir.
PG  - 9-15
AB  - An efficient whole cell biotransformation process using Lactobacillus kefir was 
      developed for the asymmetric synthesis of tert-butyl (3R, 5S) 
      6-chloro-dihydroxyhexanoate, a chiral building block for the HMG-CoA reductase 
      inhibitor. The effects of buffer concentration, temperature, pH and oxygen on the 
      asymmetric reduction were investigated in batch reactions. Improvements in final 
      product concentration and yields of 153% (120 mM) and 79% (0.85 mol/mol) with 
      respect to the batch-process were achieved in an optimised fed-batch process. The 
      pure substrate tert-butyl-6-chloro-3,5-dioxohexanoate was dispersed as microdroplets 
      into the reaction system. This resulted in a space-time yield of 4.7 mmol l(-1) 
      h(-1). A diastereomeric excess of >99% was measured for (3R, 5S) and (3S, 5S) 
      tert-butyl 6-chloro-dihydroxyhexanoate.

TI  - Enhancing effects of food components on the production of interferon β from animal 
      cells suppressed by stress hormones.
PG  - 119-25
LID - 10.1023/A:1007971906061 [doi]
AB  - In today's 'modern' society, no one can escape from the stresses of daily life. 
      Stress stimulates the secretion of stress hormones (e.g. cortisol or noradrenaline) 
      which generally suppress the immune response system, thus rendering the body 
      vulnerable to infectious diseases and cancer. Therefore finding anti-stress food 
      components, which diminish and/or inhibit the stress related suppression of the 
      immune response system would be helpful in maintaining and promoting the health of 
      the human population. Here we established a screening system for anti-stress 
      substances using the cultured human cell line MG-63. The production of interferon-β 
      (IFN-β) by MG-63 cells super-induced by Poly (I): Poly (C) was shown to decrease in 
      a dose dependent manner upon the addition of 0.01-10 μg/ml of cortisol or 
      noradrenaline (NA). 1,2-Diacylglycerol (DG) was demonstrated to abrogate this 
      suppression. Lipid from the fermented milk, kefir, also inhibited the influence of 
      cortisol. Kefiran, a polysaccharide secreted from L. kafiranofasiens GKL-28 
      diminished the cortisol or NA influenced IFN-β production. But phosphatidylcholine 
      had no significant effect in this system. These results suggest that DG, lipids from 
      kefir and kefiran may be equated as anti-stress food component.Abbreviations DG - 
      diacylglycerol; IFN-β - interferon-β; NA - noradrenaline; PC - phosphatidylcholine; 
      Poly (I):Poly (C) - polyinosinic polycytidylic acid.

PG  - 489-95
AB  - The antitumor activity of kefir (YK-1), a fermented milk product in Caucasus, was 
      investigated. YK-1 at oral doses of 100 or 500 mg/kg inhibited the proliferation of 
      solid tumor of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma transplanted subcutaneously in mice. YK-1 
      did not show an inhibitory effect on the ear swelling induced contact dermatitis 
      caused by picryl chloride (PC-CD). However, YK-1 inhibited the immunosuppression in 
      Ehrlich carcinoma-bearing mice and with the frozen and dried ascites of the 
      tumor-bearing mice containing immunosuppressive substances (EC-sup) in PC-CD-induced 
      mice. And also, YK-1 activated the immunosuppressive activity of spleen cells of 
      mouse treated with EC-sup. These results suggest that YK-1 may have antitumor 
      activity against Ehrlich carcinoma and activate the immunosuppression with it.

TI  - In Vitro Probiotic Properties and DNA Protection Activity of Yeast and Lactic Acid 
      Bacteria Isolated from A Honey-Based Kefir Beverage.

AB  - The probiotic characteristics of three acid-tolerant microbial strains, viz., 
      Lactobacillus satsumensis LPBF1, Leuconostoc mesenteroides LPBF2 and Saccharomyes 
      cerevisiae LPBF3, isolated from a honey-based kefir functional beverage, were 
      studied following the requirements established by the Food and Agriculture 
      Organization of the United Nation/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO), including 
      host-associated stress resistance, epithelium adhesion ability, and antimicrobial 
      activity. The three microbial strains tolerated different pH values (2.0, 3.0, 4.0 
      and 7.0) and bile salt concentrations (0.3% and 0.6%), and survive in the presence 
      of simulated gastric juice, which are conditions imposed by the gastrointestinal 
      tract. In addition, they showed high percentages of hydrophobicity, auto aggregation 
      and anti-pathogenic against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, with no 
      hemolytic activity. The protective capacity of human DNA through microbial treatment 
      was investigated by single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) comet assay. The three 
      selected strains showed DNA protection effect against damage caused by hydroxyl 
      radical (H(2)O(2)). However, when the S. cerevisiae treatment was applied, the most 
      effective DNA protection index was observed, which can be associated to its high 
      production of extracellular antioxidants as reveled by the 
      2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazylhydrate (DPPH) method. These results indicated that 
      the three selected microbial strains could be useful for preventing oxidative DNA 
      damage and cellular oxidation in food products. As well-adapted microbial cells, the 
      selected strains can be used for production of non-dairy functional beverages, 
      especially for vegans and/or vegetarians and lactose intolerants.

TI  - The Effect of Probiotic Yogurt on Glycemic Control in Type 2 Diabetes or Obesity: A 
      Meta-Analysis of Nine Randomized Controlled Trials.
LID - 10.3390/nu11030671 [doi]
LID - 671
AB  - Probiotic yogurt is suggested as a nutritional approach in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 
      obesity. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of probiotic yogurt on glycemic outcomes in T2D 
      or obesity. The databases used to search for RCTs included Medline and Scopus. The 
      RCTs were eligible if outcomes included selected glycemic markers. In nine eligible 
      trials, 237 and 235 subjects were in treatment (probiotic yogurt) and control 
      (mostly conventional yogurt) groups, respectively. There was no significant 
      difference for pooled unstandardized mean difference (USMD) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) 
      by probiotic yogurt compared with the control in T2D (USMD: -0.366; 95% CI: -0.755, 
      0.024, p = 0.066) and obesity (USMD: 0.116, 95% CI: -0.007, 0.238, p = 0.065). 
      Similarly, there were no effects of probiotic yogurt on fasting blood glucose, 
      fasting insulin, or insulin resistance (estimated by homeostatic model assessment of 
      insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)) in either T2D or obesity. In conclusion, the present 
      meta-analysis has not demonstrated the benefits of consuming probiotic compared with 
      conventional yogurt for improving glucose control in patients with diabetes or 
      obesity. Larger trials are needed to verify the benefits of probiotic and/or 
      conventional yogurt or other probiotic fermented milk (e.g., kefir) on glycemic 
      markers in patients with diabetes and obesity.

TI  - Highly efficient enzymatic synthesis of tert-butyl 
      (S)-6-chloro-5-hydroxy-3-oxohexanoate with a mutant alcohol dehydrogenase of 
      Lactobacillus kefir.
PG  - 8963-75
LID - 10.1007/s00253-015-6675-1 [doi]
AB  - tert-Butyl (S)-6-chloro-5-hydroxy-3-oxohexanoate ((S)-CHOH) is a valuable chiral 
      synthon, which is used for the synthesis of the cholesterol-lowering drugs 
      atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. To date, only the alcohol dehydrogenases from 
      Lactobacillus brevis (LbADH) and Lactobacillus kefir (LkADH) have demonstrated 
      catalytic activity toward the asymmetric reduction of tert-butyl 
      6-chloro-3,5-dioxohexanoate (CDOH) to (S)-CHOH. Herein, a tetrad mutant of LkADH 
      (LkTADH), A94T/F147L/L199H/A202L, was screened to be more efficient in this 
      bioreduction process, exhibiting a 3.7- and 42-fold improvement in specific activity 
      toward CDOH (1.27 U/mg) over LbADH (0.34 U/mg) and wild-type LkADH (0.03 U/mg), 
      respectively. The molecular basis for the improved catalytic activity of LkTADH 
      toward CDOH was investigated using homology modeling and docking analysis. Two major 
      issues had a significant impact on the biocatalytic efficiency of this process, 
      including (i) the poor aqueous stability of the substrate and (ii) partial substrate 
      inhibition. A fed-batch strategy was successfully developed to address these issues 
      and maintain a suitably low substrate concentration throughout the entire process. 
      Several other parameters were also optimized, including the pH, temperature, NADP(+) 
      concentration and cell loading. A final CDOH concentration of 427 mM (100 g/L) gave 
      (S)-CHOH in 94 % yield and 99.5 % e.e. after a reaction time of 38 h with whole 
      cells expressing LkTADH. The space-time yield and turnover number of NADP(+) in this 
      process were 10.6 mmol/L/h and 16,060 mol/mol, respectively, which were the highest 
      values ever reported. This new approach therefore represents a promising alternative 
      for the efficient synthesis of (S)-CHOH.

LID - 594
AB  - Κefir is a rich source of potentially probiotic bacteria. In the present study, 
      firstly, in vitro screening for probiotic characteristics of ten lactic acid 
      bacteria (LAB) isolated from kefir grains was performed. Strain AGR 4 was selected 
      for further studies. Molecular characterization of strain AGR 4, confirmed that AGR 
      4 belongs to the Lactobacillus paracasei (reclassified to Lacticaseibacillus 
      paracasei subsp. paracasei) species. Further testing revealed that L. paracasei AGR 
      4 displayed adhesion capacity on human adenocarcinoma cells, HT-29, similar to that 
      of the reference strain, L. casei ATCC 393. In addition, the novel strain exerted 
      significant time- and dose-dependent antiproliferative activity against HT-29 cells 
      and human melanoma cell line, A375, as demonstrated by the sulforhodamine B 
      cytotoxicity assay. Flow cytometry analysis was employed to investigate the 
      mechanism of cellular death; however, it was found that AGR 4 did not act by 
      inducing cell cycle arrest and/or apoptotic cell death. Taken together, these 
      findings promote the probiotic character of the newly isolated strain L. paracasei 
      AGR 4, while further studies are needed for the detailed description of its 
      biological properties.

TI  - Metabolic activities of Lactobacillus spp. strains isolated from kefir.
PG  - 218-20
AB  - A total of 21 strains of Lactobacillus species were isolated from Turkish kefir 
      samples, in order to select the most suitable strains according to their metabolic 
      activities including probiotic properties. As a result of the identification tests, 
      21 Lactobacillus isolates were identified as L. acidophilus (4%), L. helveticus 
      (9%), L. brevis (9%), L. bulgaricus (14%), L. plantarum (14%), L. casei (19%) and L. 
      lactis (28%). The amount of produced lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, proteolytic 
      activity, and acetaldehyde productions of Lactobacillus spp. were determined. 
      Different amounts of lactic acid were produced by strains studies; however, lactic 
      acid levels were 1.7-11.4 mg/mL. All strains produced hydrogen peroxide. L. 
      bulgaricus Z14L strain showed no proteolytic activity, L. casei Z6L strain produced 
      the maximum amount (0.16 mg/mL) of proteolytic activity. Acetaldehyde concentration 
      produced in Lactobacillus strains ranged between 0.88-3.52 microg/mL.

TI  - Structural investigation and response surface optimisation for improvement of 
      kefiran production yield from a low-cost culture medium.

AB  - Kefiran, a water-soluble heteropolysaccharide with molecular weight of 1.35×10(6)Da 
      and a specific optical rotation of +64° (c 1.0, H2O), was isolated from kefir grains 
      grown in cheese whey and further purified through DEAE-Sepharose XK26. Response 
      surface methodology was employed to optimise the culture conditions for kefiran 
      production from kefir grains to be lactose concentration 67 g/l, yeast extract 
      13g/l, pH 5.7 and temperature 24°C. Intrinsic viscosity was 5.84 dl/g using the 
      Huggins extrapolation and 5.53 dl/g using the Kramer extrapolation. Monosaccharide 
      analysis revealed that kefiran is composed of glucose (Glc) and galactose (Gal) in a 
      relative molar ratio of 1.0:1.1. Its structural features were elucidated by a 
      combination of FT-IR, methylation and GC-MS analysis, periodate oxidation-Smith 
      degradation, partial acid hydrolysis and NMR spectroscopy ((1)H, (13)C and HMBC). 
      The data obtained indicated that kefiran possessed a backbone of (1→6)-linked Glc, 
      (1→3)-linked Gal, (1→4)-linked Gal, (1→4)-linked Glc and (1→2,6)-linked Gal, with a 
      branch attached to O-2 of Gal residues and terminated with Glc residues.

AB  - Mycobacterium bovis that causes Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) can be transmitted to 
      humans thought consumption of raw and raw fermented milk products from diseased 
      animals. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) used in popular traditional milk products in 
      Africa produce anti-microbial compounds that inhibit some pathogenic and spoilage 
      bacteria. M. bovis BCG is an attenuated non-pathogenic vaccine strain of M. bovis 
      and the aim of the study was to determine the effect of the fermentation process on 
      the survival of M. bovis BCG in milk. M. bovis BCG at concentrations of 6 log CFU/ml 
      was added to products of kefir fermentation. The survival of M. bovis BCG was 
      monitored at 12-h intervals for 72 h by enumerating viable cells on Middlebrook 7H10 
      agar plates enriched with 2% BD BACTEC PANTA™. M. bovis BCG was increasingly reduced 
      in sterile kefir that was fermented for a period of 24h and longer. In the milk 
      fermented with kefir grains, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei or 
      Lactobacillus casei, the viability of M. bovis BCG was reduced by 0.4 logs after 24h 
      and by 2 logs after 48 h of fermentation. No viable M. bovis BCG was detected after 
      60 h of fermentation. Results from this study show that long term fermentation under 
      certain conditions may have the potential to inactivate M. bovis BCG present in the 
      milk. However, to ensure safety of fermented milk in Africa, fermentation should be 
      combined with other hurdle technologies such as boiling and milk pasteurisation.

TI  - Dairy Fats and Cardiovascular Disease: Do We Really Need to be Concerned?
LID - 10.3390/foods7030029 [doi]
LID - 29
AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain a major cause of death and morbidity globally 
      and diet plays a crucial role in the disease prevention and pathology. The negative 
      perception of dairy fats stems from the effort to reduce dietary saturated fatty 
      acid (SFA) intake due to their association with increased cholesterol levels upon 
      consumption and the increased risk of CVD development. Institutions that set dietary 
      guidelines have approached dairy products with negative bias and used poor 
      scientific data in the past. As a result, the consumption of dairy products was 
      considered detrimental to our cardiovascular health. In western societies, dietary 
      trends indicate that generally there is a reduction of full-fat dairy product 
      consumption and increased low-fat dairy consumption. However, recent research and 
      meta-analyses have demonstrated the benefits of full-fat dairy consumption, based on 
      higher bioavailability of high-value nutrients and anti-inflammatory properties. In 
      this review, the relationship between dairy consumption, cardiometabolic risk 
      factors and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases are discussed. Functional dairy 
      foods and the health implications of dairy alternatives are also considered. In 
      general, evidence suggests that milk has a neutral effect on cardiovascular outcomes 
      but fermented dairy products, such as yoghurt, kefir and cheese may have a positive 
      or neutral effect. Particular focus is placed on the effects of the lipid content on 
      cardiovascular health.

TI  - Identification and characterization of a glucan-producing enzyme from Lactobacillus 
      hilgardii TMW 1.828 involved in granule formation of water kefir.

AB  - Water kefir is a home made fermented beverage based on a sucrose solution with fruit 
      extracts. The inoculum of such fermentations consists of macroscopic granula 
      containing lactic and acetic acid bacteria, and yeasts, which are embedded in an 
      exopolysaccharide (EPS) matrix. In this work, a strain of Lactobacillus hilgardii 
      producing large amounts of the granule-forming dextran could be isolated. The 
      glycosyltransferans (Gtf) commonly called glucansucrase responsible for the 
      production of this dextran was purified from L. hilgardii. Characteristic enzyme 
      kinetic data were obtained. Optimum activity was observed between pH 4.3 and 4.6 and 
      temperatures between 40 degrees C and 45 degrees C. A Michaelis-Menten kinetic could 
      be fit to the experimental data and a K(M) of 0.0385 M was calculated. The 
      corresponding gtf gene was identified and characterized. It encodes a 1448 amino 
      acid protein with higher homologies to Gtfs of Lactobacillus parabuchneri, 
      Lactobacillus sakei and Lactobacillus fermentum followed by lower homologies to 
      Lactobacillus reuteri Gtfs. By knockout experiments the role of this gene in granule 
      dextran production was demonstrated.

TI  - Continuous whey fermentation using kefir yeast immobilized on delignified cellulosic 
      material.
PG  - 2543-7
AB  - Delignified cellulosic-supported biocatalyst, prepared by immobilization of kefir 
      yeast on delignified cellulosic material (DCM), was found to be suitable for 
      continuous, modified whey fermentation. The modified whey contained 1% raisin 
      extract and molasses. Ethanol productivities ranged from 3.6 to 8.3 g L(-1)day(-1), 
      whereas parameters such as ethanol concentration, residual sugars, and daily 
      fermented whey productivity were acceptable for the production of potable alcohol 
      and alcoholic drinks in industrial fermentations. The continuous fermentation 
      bioreactor was operated for 39 days, stored for 18 days at 4 degrees C, and operated 
      again for another 15 days without any diminution of the ethanol productivity. The 
      concentrations of higher alcohols (propanol-1, isobutyl alcohol, and amyl alcohols) 
      were low. The main volatile byproducts formed in the continuous process were similar 
      to those observed in alcoholic beverages, and the fermented whey had a good aroma. 
      The concentrations of higher alcohols were very low when compared to that of ethyl 
      acetate, therefore resulting in a quality product. The possibility of using such a 
      process for the production of potable alcohol or a novel, low-alcohol content drink 
      is proposed.

AB  - Tibetan kefir grains (TKGs), natural starters for milk fermentation, are believed to 
      comprise diverse microflora of lactic acid and acetic acid bacteria. In order to 
      better understand the bacterial community in TKGs, TKGs that had been cultured 
      continuously either naturally or aseptically for 10 months were subject to analysis 
      using both culture-dependent and various culture-independent methods. Results of 
      DGGE, metagenomics, FISH, qPCR and isolation all demonstrated that Lactobacillus 
      kefiranofaciens is the only dominant and stable bacterial species in TKGs regardless 
      of culture conditions and time. FISH and SEM showed that L. kefiranofaciens 
      exhibited two distinct morphotypes of short rod (3.0 μm in length) and long rod 
      (10.0 μm in length) upon colonization of either the outer surface or inner component 
      of TKGs, providing evidence for its trophic adaptation to the hollow globular grain 
      structure of TKGs. These findings pave ways for further study of the specific 
      symbiotic interaction between L. kefiranofaciens and the dominant Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae yeast in TKGs in vivo.

TI  - An economic evaluation of freeze-dried kefir starter culture production using whey.
PG  - 2175-80
AB  - An economic study is presented in which industrial-scale production of freeze-dried 
      kefir starter culture is discussed based on results on a laboratory scale. 
      Industrial scale-up was based on a 3-step process using 3 bioreactors of 100, 3,000, 
      and 30,000 L for 300 kg of freeze-dried culture/d of plant capacity. The major cost 
      component of the total investment was the freeze-drying machinery, which consisted 
      of 57% of the total investment. Production cost was reduced from 15.4 euros/kg 
      ($18.5/kg) to 2.9 euros/kg ($3.5/kg) when the production capacity was increased from 
      30 to 900 kg/d. An economic analysis revealed a 3.5-fold increase in production cost 
      compared with the corresponding production cost of the wet product, with an added 
      value of up to 10.8 x 10(9) euros ($13.0 x 10(9)) within the European Union.

AB  - The development of a biocatalytic process concept for ɛ-caprolactone, which directly 
      converts cyclohexanol as an easily available industrial raw material into the 
      desired ɛ-caprolactone in a one-pot fashion while only requiring air as sole 
      reagent, is reported. The desired product ɛ-caprolactone was obtained with 94-97% 
      conversion when operating at a substrate concentration in the range of 20-60 mM. At 
      higher substrate concentrations, however, a significant drop of conversion was 
      found. Subsequent detailed studies on the impact of the starting material, 
      intermediate and product components revealed a significant inhibition and partial 
      deactivation of the BVMO by the product ɛ-caprolactone (in particular at higher 
      concentrations) as well as an inhibition of the BVMO by cyclohexanol and 
      cyclohexanone.

AB  - An exopolysaccharide (EPS) producing strain, ZW3, was isolated from Tibet kefir 
      grain and was identified as Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. FT-IR spectroscopy 
      revealed the presence of carboxyl, hydroxyl, and amide groups, which correspond to a 
      typical heteropolymeric polysaccharide. The GC analysis of ZW3 EPS revealed that it 
      was glucogalactan in nature. Exopolymer showed similar flocculation stability like 
      xanthan gum but better than guar gum with a melting point of 93.38 degrees C which 
      is lower than xanthan gum (153.4 degrees C) and guar gum (490.11 degrees C). 
      Compared with other commercially available hydrocolloids like xanthan gum, guar gum 
      and locust gum ZW3 EPS showed much better emulsifying capability.

TI  - Evaluation of dairy products available on the Polish market in the context of 
      nutrient profiles. Clear arguments for reformulation of foodstuffs.
PG  - 43-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dairy products, which are one of the main groups of products in the 
      diet, are expected to have high nutritional value. The development of food 
      technology often involves changing the nutritional parameters of foodstuffs. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the nutritional value of dairy 
      products, in the context of nutrient profiles. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The tested 
      products included yoghurts, yoghurt drinks, kefir, cream cheeses and milk desserts 
      available on the Polish market, basing on the information from unit product 
      packaging. RESULTS: The average sugar content in the group of all products was 11 
      g/100 g. Milk desserts contained the largest amount of sugar (average 14.7 g/100g), 
      whereas kefir – the smallest amount (average 6 g/100 g) (p <0.0001). Yoghurts and 
      yoghurt drinks intended for children had higher sugar content than products for the 
      general population (14.4 g vs. 10.5 g/100 g) (p <0.0001). As many as 75% of products 
      were sweetened. Taking into account the natural content of lactose, the estimated 
      amount of added sugar ranged from 6.9 - 12.3 g/100 g. The average fat content in the 
      group of all products amounted to 3.8 g/100 g. In the view of WHO profiles, 71% of 
      products exceeded the permissible sugar content (≤ 10 g/100 g) and 36% exceeded the 
      permissible content of saturated fatty acids (≤ 2 g/100 g). Using more liberal 
      profiles developed by the food industry, the proportion of such products was 
      smaller, but still quite high (34% in case of sugar and 26% in case of saturated 
      fatty acids). In terms of the sugar content, according to regulation introduced in 
      Poland, only 29% of the analyzed dairy products could be offer for children at 
      schools. Among them there are all natural (not sweetened) yoghurts and kefir and 
      only 6% of other sweetened products. CONCLUSIONS: There is a justified need for the 
      reformulation of dairy products, especially in terms of added sugar.

AB  - Fermentation technology has become a modern method for food production the last 
      decades as a process for enhancing product stability, safety and sensory standards. 
      The main reason for this development is the increasing consumers' demand for safe 
      and high quality food products. The above has led the scientific community to the 
      thorough study for the appropriate selection of specific microorganisms with 
      desirable properties such as bacteriocin production, and probiotic properties. The 
      main food products produced through fermentation activity are bread, wine, beer 
      cheese and other dairy products. The microorganisms conducting the above processes 
      are mainly yeasts and lactic acid bacteria. The end products of carbohydrate 
      catabolism by these microorganisms contribute not only to preservation as it was 
      believed years ago, but also to the flavour, aroma and texture and to the increase 
      of the nutritional quality by thereby helping determine unique product 
      characteristics. Thus, controlling the function of specific microorganisms or the 
      succession of microorganisms that dominate the microflora is therefore advantageous, 
      because it can increase product quality, functionality and value. Throughout the 
      process of the discovery of microbiological diversity in various fermented food 
      systems, the development of starter culture technology has gained more scientific 
      attention, and it could be used for the control of the manufacturing operation, and 
      management of product quality. In the frame of this review the presentation of the 
      quality enhancement of most consumed fermented food products around the world is 
      attempted and the new trends in production of fermented food products, such as bread 
      is discussed. The review is focused in kefir grains application in bread production.

AB  - The chitosanase and chitinase activity were revealed in the culture supernatant of 
      Bacillus cereus TKU027 with shrimp head powder (SHP) as the sole carbon/nitrogen 
      source. The chitosan with 60% degree of deacetylation (DD) was depolymerized by 
      TKU027 crude enzyme. The low DP oligomers stimulated the growth of Lactobacillus 
      paracasei BCRC12193 and Lactobacillus kefir BCRC14011 in a MRS broth supplemented 
      with low DP oligomers for 12 h. Conversely, the high DP oligomers (0.1%) had potent 
      inhibitory effects against L. paracasei BCRC12193 and L. kefir BCRC14011 for 48 h. 
      Besides, the study also investigated the effects of B. cereus TKU027 on degradation 
      of SHP and the survival conditions of bacteria in mangrove river sediment of Tamsui 
      River. The 5 weeks-incubation sample of SHP and B. cereus TKU027-amended mangrove 
      river sediment showed the highest amounts of biomass, reducing sugar and total 
      sugar, and some variance of bacterial community compositions existed in the soils.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the application of high-resolution melt (HRM) analysis for rapid 
      species-level identification of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in dairy 
      products, as well as for bacterial community profiling and monitoring. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: First, comparisons of HRM profiles of known reference strains of LAB and 
      their denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) bands showed very good 
      agreement, allowing species recognition and identification from DGGE bands by HRM. 
      Second, samples of cheese, kefir grains and kefir were characterized by PCR-DGGE, 
      and melting profiles of DGGE bands were compared with known reference strains. Of 
      the 13 DGGE bands, ten were identified by HRM by comparison with the reference 
      strains and only three required sequencing for identification. Use of HRM profiling 
      for comparison and monitoring of total LAB communities from dairy products or 
      starter cultures was also evaluated, and good agreement was found when comparing 
      clustering of DGGE band profiles with clustering of HRM melting profiles. 
      CONCLUSION: Identification of DGGE bands is possible by comparison of HRM melting 
      profiles with known reference strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: HRM 
      profiling is suggested as an additional approach for identification of DGGE bands.

TI  - Purification and gene cloning of a dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis that 
      catalyzes a reaction involved in aflatoxin biosynthesis.
PG  - 724-34
AB  - When 10 strains of lactic acid bacteria were incubated with 5'-hydroxyaverantin 
      (HAVN), a precursor of aflatoxins, seven of them converted HAVN to averufin; the 
      same reaction is found in aflatoxin biosynthesis of aflatoxigenic fungi. These 
      bacteria had a dehydrogenase that catalyzed the reaction from HAVN to 
      5'-oxoaverantin (OAVN), which was so unstable that it was easily converted to 
      averufin. The enzyme was purified from Lactobacillus brevis IFO 12005. The molecular 
      mass of the enzyme was 100 kDa on gel filtration chromatography and 33 kDa on SDS 
      polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The gene encoding the enzyme was 
      cloned and sequenced. The deduced protein consisted of 249 amino acids, and its 
      estimated molecular mass was 25,873, in agreement with that by time of flight mass 
      spectrometry (TOF MS) analysis. Although the deduced amino acid sequence showed 
      about 50% identity to those reported for alcohol dehydrogenases from L. brevis or L. 
      kefir, the commercially available alcohol dehydrogenase from L. kefir did not 
      convert HAVN to OAVN. Aspergillus parasiticus HAVN dehydrogenase showed about 25% 
      identity in amino acid sequence with the dehydrogenase and also with these two 
      alcohol dehydrogenases.

AB  - Adequate radiological protection requires the quantification of radionuclide 
      transfer to the human food chain, which is essential for the estimation of ingestion 
      doses. Transfer parameters are key inputs for the development of radioecological 
      models and decision support systems. There are many literature compilations of these 
      parameters, however, most of values were calculated in temperate climates, and data 
      for Mediterranean ecosystems are scarce. In this study, transfer factors to 
      foodstuffs collected in Mediterranean ecosystems, in Spain, were compared to 
      reported values for temperate climate. Foodstuff included cereals, meat (beef, lamb 
      and pork), dairy products (milk, cheese yogurt, and kefir), and also typical 
      products of Mediterranean diet, such as olives, olive oil, grapes and wine. 
      Radioactive ((137)Cs, (226,228)Ra and (4)(0) K) and stable elements (Cs, Sr, K, Na, 
      Ca, Mg, P, Pb, U and Th) were measured to enable the calculation of transfer 
      factors. As a consequence, data for transfer factors in Mediterranean systems were 
      increased by about 120 and 200 values for plant and animal products, respectively. 
      Due to the low level radiocaesium concentration in Spanish ecosystems, transfer 
      factors for this radioisotope were largely 'less than' values. Therefore, stable Cs 
      and Sr transfer factors were used as proxy for comparison with temperate values.

TI  - Use of whey lactose from dairy industry for economical kefiran production by 
      Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens in mixed cultures with yeasts.
PG  - 574-80
LID - 10.1016/j.nbt.2011.01.009 [doi]
AB  - To evaluate the feasibility of producing kefiran industrially, whey lactose, a 
      by-product from dairy industry, was used as a low cost carbon source. Because the 
      accumulation of lactic acid as a by-product of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens 
      inhibited cell growth and kefiran production, the kefir grain derived and 
      non-derived yeasts were screened for their abilities to reduce lactic acid and 
      promote kefiran production in a mixed culture. Six species of yeasts were examined: 
      Torulaspora delbrueckii IFO 1626; Saccharomyces cerevisiae IFO 0216; Debaryomyces 
      hansenii TISTR 5155; Saccharomyces exiguus TISTR 5081; Zygosaccharomyces rouxii 
      TISTR 5044; and Saccharomyces carlsbergensis TISTR 5018. The mixed culture of L. 
      kefiranofaciens with S. cerevisiae IFO 0216 enhanced the kefiran production best 
      from 568 mg/L in the pure culture up to 807 and 938 mg/L in the mixed cultures under 
      anaerobic and microaerobic conditions, respectively. The optimal conditions for 
      kefiran production by the mixed culture were: whey lactose 4%; yeast extract 4%; 
      initial pH of 5.5; and initial amounts of L. kefiranofaciens and S. cerevisiae IFO 
      0216 of 2.1×10(7) and 4.0×10(6)CFU/mL, respectively. Scaling up the mixed culture in 
      a 2L bioreactor with dissolved oxygen control at 5% and pH control at 5.5 gave the 
      maximum kefiran production of 2,580 mg/L in batch culture and 3,250 mg/L in 
      fed-batch culture.

AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen associated with life-threatening 
      nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Antibiotic resistance is an immediate 
      threat to public health and demands an urgent action to discovering new 
      antimicrobial agents. One of the best alternatives for pre-clinical tests with 
      animal models is the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella. Here, we evaluated the 
      antipseudomonal activity of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) against P. aeruginosa 
      strain UCBPP-PA14 using G. mellonella larvae. The AgNPs were synthesized through a 
      non-toxic biogenic process involving microorganism fermentation. The effect of AgNPs 
      was assessed through characterization and quantification of the hemocytic response, 
      nodulation and phenoloxidase cascade. On average, 80% of the larvae infected with P. 
      aeruginosa and prophylactically treated with nanoparticles survived. Both the 
      specific and total larvae hemocyte counts were restored in the treated group. In 
      addition, the nodulation process and the phenoloxidase cascade were less exacerbated 
      when the larvae were exposed to the silver nanoparticles. AgNPs protect the larvae 
      from P. aeruginosa infection by directly killing the bacteria and indirectly by 
      preventing an exacerbated immunological response against the pathogen. Our results 
      suggest that the prophylactic use of AgNPs has a strong protective activity against 
      P. aeruginosa infection.

AB  - In this study, we report the first successful production of kefiran nanofibers 
      through electrospinning process using distilled water as solvent. For this purpose, 
      kefiran was extracted from cultured kefir grains, and homogenous kefiran solutions 
      with different concentrations were prepared and then electrospun to obtain uniform 
      nanofibers. The effect of main process parameters, including applied voltage, 
      tip-to-collector distance, and feeding rate, on diameter and morphology of produced 
      nanofibers, was studied. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and attenuated total 
      reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy were used to 
      characterize electrospun mats. Rheological behavior of the kefiran solution was 
      evaluated via a cone and plate rheometer too. The results exhibited that diameter of 
      kefiran nanofibers increased with increasing polymer concentration, applied voltage, 
      and polymer feeding rate, while tip-to-collector distance did not have significant 
      effect on nanofiber diameter. ATR-FTIR spectra showed that kefiran has maintained 
      its molecular structure during electrospinning process. Flow curves also 
      demonstrated shear thinning behavior for kefiran solutions.

AB  - Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP), etiological agent of paratuberculosis in 
      ruminants, is able to survive extreme conditions like very low pH (stomach), high 
      temperature (pasteurization) or low temperature (refrigerated storage). Cheese, 
      infant powder milk, cream and other milk and dairy products might thus be considered 
      as possible sources of MAP for humans. The aim of this study was to investigate the 
      survival of two MAP field isolates during fermentation of three different types of 
      soured milk products (SMP; yogurt, acidophilus milk and kefir) under laboratory 
      conditions. Pasteurized MAP-free milk was artificially contaminated with 
      10(6)MAPcells/mL and survival and absolute numbers of MAP were monitored during 
      fermentation (4 or 16 h) and after six weeks of storage at 4°C by culture and 
      quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). Viability of MAP was determined by culture using 
      Herrold's egg yolk medium and Middlebrook 7H10 with antibiotics, supplemented with 
      Mycobactin J and incubated at 37°C for up to 12 weeks. The absolute numbers of MAP 
      were quantified by previously published qPCR assays targeting F57 and IS900 loci in 
      MAP genome. We herein confirm that MAP can survive pH reduction, however, longer 
      exposure to pH below 4 in SMP seems to be critical because it inhibits growth. 
      Therefore, it is suggested that probiotic cultures that can decrease pH below 4 
      during fermentation could provide better inactivation of MAP in SMP.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of Lactobacillus plantarum 
      MA2, an isolate from Chinese traditional Tibet kefir, on cholesterol-lowering and 
      microflora of rat in vivo. Rats were fed on cholesterol-enriched experimental diet, 
      supplemented with lyophilized L. plantarum MA2 powder, with a dose of 10(11) 
      cells/day per mice. The results showed that L. plantarum MA2 feeding significantly 
      lowered serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 
      triglycerides level, while there was no change in high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol. In addition, liver total cholesterol and triglycerides was also 
      decreased. However, fecal cholesterol and triglycerides was increased significantly 
      (P < 0.05) in comparison with the control. Also, L. plantarum MA2 increased the 
      population of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria in the fecal, but it did not 
      change the number of Escherichia coli as compared to control. Moreover, pH, 
      moisture, and organic acids in the fecal were also measured. The present results 
      indicate the probiotic potential of the L. plantarum MA2 strain in 
      hypocholesterolemic effect and also increasing the probiotic count in the intestine.

TI  - Purification and kinetics of two novel thermophilic extracellular proteases from 
      Lactobacillus helveticus, from kefir with possible biotechnological interest.
PG  - 5804-13
AB  - Two thermophilic extracellular proteases, designated Lmm-protease-Lh ( approximately 
      29 kDa) and Hmm-protease-Lh ( approximately 62 kDa), were purified from the 
      Lactobacillus helveticus from kefir, and found active in media containing 
      dithiothreitol; the activity of Lmm-protease-Lh was increased significantly in media 
      containing also EDTAK(2). Both novel proteases maintained full activity at 60 
      degrees C after 1-h incubation at 10 degrees C as well as at 80 degrees C, showing 
      optimum k(cat)/K(m) values at pH 7.00 and 60 degrees C. Only irreversible inhibitors 
      specific for cysteine proteinases strongly inhibited the activity of both novel 
      enzymes, while they remained unaffected by irreversible inhibitors specific for 
      serine proteinases. Both enzymes hydrolyzed the substrate Suc-FR-pNA via 
      Michaelis-Menten kinetics; conversely, the substrate Cbz-FR-pNA was hydrolyzed by 
      Lmm-protease-Lh via Michaelis-Menten kinetics and by Hmm-protease-Lh via substrate 
      inhibition kinetics. Valuable rate constants and activation energies were estimated 
      from the temperature-(k(cat)/K(m)) profiles of both enzymes, and useful results were 
      obtained from the effect of different metallic ions on their Michaelis-Menten 
      parameters.

TI  - Characterization of liposomes coated with S-layer proteins from lactobacilli.
PG  - 393-400
AB  - The stability of liposomes coated with S-layer proteins from Lactobacillus brevis 
      and Lactobacillus kefir was analyzed as a previous stage to the development of a 
      vaccine vehicle for oral administration. The interactions of the different S-layer 
      proteins with positively charged liposomes prepared with soybean lecithin or 
      dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine were studied by means of the variation of the Z 
      potential at different protein-lipid ratios, showing that both proteins were able to 
      attach in a greater extent to the surface of soybean lecithin liposomes. The 
      capacity of these particles to retain carboxyfluorescein or calcein by exposure to 
      bile salts, pancreatic extract, pH change and after a thermal shock showed that both 
      S-layer proteins increased the stability of the liposomes in the same magnitude. The 
      non-glycosylated protein from L. brevis protects more efficiently the liposomes at 
      pH 7 than those from L. kefir even without treatment with glutaraldehyde.

TI  - [Nitrate-reducing microorganisms in milk products and human milk].
PG  - 53-6
AB  - The quantitative determination of nitrate-reducing microorganisms in food is 
      important because of their role in the formation of N-nitroso compounds and 
      methemoglobin. The total counts of microorganisms and the counts of nitrate-reducing 
      microorganisms were assayed in various milk products and in human milk by the method 
      of the most probable numbers using nitrate broth medium. The mean value and standard 
      deviation of the nitrate-reducing microorganisms were the following: in pasteurized 
      milk 3.4 +/- 1.1 log/ml (in spring and summer 4.2 +/- 1.1, and in winter 2.8 +/- 0.6 
      log/ml), in kefir "Tallinn' 2.9 +/- 1.1 log/ml, in fat kefir 2.9 +/- +/- 0.7 log/ml, 
      in sour milk 3.9 +/- 0.5 log/ml, in fresh milk 4.6 +/- 0.6 log/ml and in human milk 
      2.7 +/- +/- 1.1 log/ml. The amount of nitrate-reducing microorganisms in pasteurized 
      milk of the spring-summer period and in fresh milk was significantly higher than in 
      human milk. The mean count of nitrate-reducing microorganisms in human milk is 
      regarded as a maximum permitted count of these organisms in milk for bottle-fed 
      sucklings. For them and for atrophic gastritis patients pasteurized or fresh milk 
      should be boiled.

TI  - Assessment of nutritional behaviour of children aged 3-7 from selected kindergartens 
      in Biala Podlaska county.
PG  - 289-297
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children constitute a group that is particularly susceptible to the 
      effects of improper nutrition. The knowledge of parents and guardians about proper 
      nutrition affects their children’s nutritional habits and behaviours. Children 
      develop their patterns of nutritional behaviours on the basis of their observations 
      of nutritional habits of adults, nutrition trends and nutritional education. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess nutritional behaviours of children 
      aged 3-7 from selected kindergartens in Biala Podlaska county. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 
      The research included 549 children, i.e. 258 girls (47%) and 291 boys (53%) aged 3-7 
      years. The study was conducted in 2015 within the county health prevention and 
      promotion programme titled “Together for heart” in several selected kindergartens in 
      Biala Podlaska county. A questionnaire prepared by the authors and distributed among 
      parents of the examined children was used in the study. The questions regarded the 
      frequency and number of meals, types of products consumed between the meals and the 
      frequency of consuming fruit and vegetables, sweets, fizzy drinks, fast foods and 
      milk or dairy products (natural yoghurt, kefir, cottage cheese). Differences between 
      the responses to the questions in groups divided according to sex were analysed with 
      the use of χ2 test (G function). RESULTS: It was revealed that 219 girls (84.9%) and 
      273 boys (93.8%) had at least four meals a day while 23.7% of the children left home 
      without breakfast. The main meal, i.e. dinner, was eaten by 227 girls and 256 boys 
      every day, which constituted 88% of each gender group. In turn, 20 girls and 27 boys 
      (8% and 9% of the study participants, respectively) regularly skipped supper. The 
      most common products consumed between the main meals were fruit and vegetables 
      (eaten by 44% of the girls and 39% of the boys). It was declared that dairy products 
      (milk, natural yoghurt and/or kefir) were consumed once a week or less frequently by 
      43% of the girls and 45% of the boys. Cottage cheese was equally rarely eaten, i.e. 
      48% of the girls and 44% of the boys reported having it once a week or less 
      frequently. The study also revealed insufficient consumption of fish. It was eaten 
      once a week or less frequently by 60% of the girls and 50% of the boys. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The assessment of nutritional behaviours revealed mistakes which may negatively 
      affect proper development if they are repeated. It seems necessary to implement 
      nutritional education among children and their parents in order to shape proper 
      nutritional behaviours and correct mistakes.

AB  - Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) have been recovered from different 
      ecological niches, however, little is known about the genetic relatedness of these 
      isolates. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing to compare mecA positive 
      (mecA (+)) Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and 
      Staphylococcus hominis isolates recovered from hand-touched surfaces from general 
      public settings in East and West London with data of isolates deposited to European 
      Nucleotide Archive (ENA) by other research groups. These included isolates 
      associated with hospital settings (including those recovered from patients), healthy 
      humans, livestock, pets, plants and natural, and other public environments. Using 
      core and accessory phylogenetic analyses we were able to identify that the mecA(+) 
      S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus isolates recovered from general public settings 
      were genetically related to isolates recovered from the bloodstream, urinary tract 
      and eye infections. S. epidermidis isolates recovered in our study were also shown 
      to be genetically related to isolates previously recovered from livestock/livestock 
      housing, whereas S. haemolyticus isolates were genetically related to isolates 
      recovered from a dog and kefir (fermented cow milk drink). MecA (+) S. hominis 
      isolates were not genetically related to any isolates recovered from clinical 
      samples but were genetically related to isolates recovered from mosquitoes, air 
      samples (residential areas) and kefir. All three species showed to have genetic 
      relatedness to isolates recovered from healthy humans. These results show that CoNS 
      isolates in this study share genetic similarities with those of different lineages 
      and that mecA(+) S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus isolates found in general public 
      settings in this study may pose a risk to public health.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the oral administration 
      of kefiran on the balance of immune cells in a murine model. Six week old BALB/c 
      mice were treated with kefiran (300 mg/L) for 0, 2 and 7 days. Kefiran treatment 
      increased the number of IgA+ cells in lamina propria after 2 and 7 days. Percentage 
      of B220+/MHCII(high) cells in mesenteric lymph nodes (2 days) and Peyer's patches (7 
      days) was higher compared to untreated control mice. An increase of macrophages 
      (F4/80+ cells) was observed in lamina propria and peritoneal cavity (2 and 7 days). 
      In contrast, at day 7, macrophage population decreased in Peyer's patches. These 
      results show the ability of kefiran to modify the balance of immune cells in 
      intestinal mucosa. This property could be highly relevant for the comprehension of 
      the probiotic effect attributed to kefir.

AB  - In this work, a simple and fast methodology has been validated and applied for the 
      analysis of a group of 22 estrogenic compounds including eight phytoestrogens (i.e. 
      daidzein, enterodiol, glycitein, enterolactone, genistein, formononetin, prunetin, 
      biochanin A), six mycotoxins (β-zearalanol, β-zearalenol, α-zearalanol, 
      α-zearalenol, zearalanone, zearalenone) as well as four synthetic (i.e. 
      ethynylestradiol, diethylstilbestrol, dienestrol, hexestrol) and four natural 
      estrogens (i.e. estriol, 17β-estradiol, 17α-estradiol, estrone) in different dairy 
      products. Extraction was carried out using the QuEChERS method while separation, 
      determination and quantification of the target analytes were achieved by 
      ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to triple quadrupole mass 
      spectrometry with an electrospray ionization interface. The methodology was 
      validated for four dairy product samples with relevant interest for the population 
      including skimmed and whole cheese and goat and cow kefir, using 
      17β-estradiol-2,4,16,16,17-d(5) as internal standard for natural and synthetic 
      estrogens and β-zeralanol-10,10,11,12,12-d(5) as internal standard for mycotoxins 
      and phytoestrogens. Recovery ranged from 70 to 119% for the four types of matrices 
      with RSD values lower than 14% and the limits of quantification of the method 
      achieved were in the range 0.025-2.50μg/kg for all samples. Finally, the analysis of 
      commercially available products was carried out finding the presence of daidzein, 
      glycitein enterolactone and genistein in some of the studied samples.

AB  - Botanical fermented foods have been shown to improve human health, based on the 
      activity of potentially beneficial lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts and their 
      metabolic outputs. However, few studies have explored the effects of prolonged 
      storage and functional spices on microbial viability of whole fermented foods from 
      fermentation to digestion. Even fewer have assessed their impact on the gut 
      microbiota. Our study investigated the effects of production processes on LAB and 
      yeast microbial viability and gut microbiota composition. We achieved this by using 
      physicochemical assessments and an in vitro gastrointestinal and a porcine gut 
      microbiota model. In low-salt sauerkraut, we assessed the effects of salt 
      concentration, starter cultures, and prolonged storage, and in tibicos, prolonged 
      storage and the addition of spices cayenne, ginger, and turmeric. In both food 
      matrices, LAB counts significantly increased (p<0.05), reaching a peak of 7-8 log 
      cfu/g, declining to 6-6.5 log cfu/g by day 96. Yeast viability remained at 5-6 log 
      cfu/g in tibicos. Ginger tibicos had significantly increased LAB and yeast viability 
      during fermentation and storage (p<0.05). For maximum microbial consumption, tibicos 
      should be consumed within 28days, and sauerkraut, 7weeks. Simulated upper GI 
      digestion of both products resulted in high microbial survival rates of 70-80%. The 
      82% microbial survival rate of cayenne tibicos was significantly higher than other 
      treatments (p<0.05). 16S rRNA sequencing of simulated porcine colonic microbiota 
      showed that both spontaneously fermented sauerkraut and tibicos increase the 
      relative abundance of Megasphaera 85-fold. These findings will inform researchers, 
      producers, and consumers about the factors that affect the microbial content of 
      fermented foods, and their potential effects on the gut.

AB  - A total of eight strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated from water kefir 
      grains and assessed for their in vitro α-glucosidase inhibitory activity. 
      Lactobacillus mali K8 demonstrated significantly higher inhibition as compared to 
      the other strains, thus was selected for in vitro probiotic potential 
      characterization, antibiotic resistance, hemolytic activity and adaptation to 
      pumpkin fruit puree. L. mali K8 demonstrated tolerance to pH 2.5 and resisted the 
      damaging effects of bile salts, pepsin and pancreatin, comparable to that of 
      Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG ATCC 53103 (reference strain). Lack of hemolytic activity 
      and susceptibility to the five standard antibiotics indicated the safety of the K8 
      strain. This strain showed singular properties to be used as starters in the pumpkin 
      fruit puree fermentation. These preliminary in vitro tests indicated the safety and 
      functionality of the K8 strain and its potential as a probiotic candidate.

PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.11.046 [doi]
AB  - Kefiran, the polysaccharide produced by microorganisms present in kefir grains, is a 
      water-soluble branched glucogalactan containing equal amounts of D-glucose and 
      D-galactose. In this study, the effect of kefiran on the biological activity of 
      Bacillus cereus strain B10502 extracellular factors was assessed by using cultured 
      human enterocytes (Caco-2 cells) and human erythrocytes. In the presence of kefiran 
      concentrations ranging from 300 to 1000 mg/L, the ability of B. cereus B10502 spent 
      culture supernatants to detach and damage cultured human enterocytes was 
      significantly abrogated. In addition, mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity was 
      higher when kefiran was present during the cell toxicity assays. Protection was also 
      demonstrated in hemolysis and apoptosis/necrosis assays. Scanning electron 
      microscopy showed the protective effect of kefiran against structural cell damages 
      produced by factors synthesized by B. cereus strain B10502. Protective effect of 
      kefiran depended on strain of B. cereus. Our findings demonstrate the ability of 
      kefiran to antagonize key events of B. cereus B10502 virulence. This property, 
      although strain-specific, gives new perspectives for the role of bacterial 
      exopolysaccharides in functional foods.

TI  - Structural characterization and biological activities of an exopolysaccharide 
      kefiran produced by Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens WT-2B(T).
PG  - 5533-8
AB  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, isolated from kefir grains, produces an extracellular 
      polysaccharide when cultured, not only in PYG10 medium but also in a liquid medium 
      containing a rice hydrolysate that had been previously degraded by treatment with a 
      glucoamylase. The maximum yield of the polysaccharide, using the rice hydrolysate as 
      the medium, was 2.5 g/L after a 7-day culture period at pH 5.0 and 33 degrees C. 
      Compositional analysis, methylation analysis, specific rotation, and (1)H and (13)C 
      NMR spectroscopy revealed that the structures of polysaccharides obtained from these 
      two different culture media are essentially identical. The polysaccharide is 
      composed of a hexasaccharide repeating unit and, thus, is known as kefiran. The 
      weight-average molecular weight and the z-average radius of gyration of a sample, 
      purified from the rice hydrolysate medium, were determined to be 7.6 x 10(5) g/mol 
      and 39.9 nm, respectively, by gel permeation chromatography equipped with a 
      multiangle laser-light-scattering photometer. Changes in blood pressure and serum 
      components were examined in SHRSP/Hos rats, using doses of 100 and 300 mg of 
      kefiran/kg of rat. A suppression in the increase in blood pressure was observed in 
      these rats after 30 days. This activity is discussed in terms of the concentration 
      of serum components of the rat, with emphasis on lipid components such as 
      cholesterols, triglycerides, and free fatty acids.

PG  - 50-2
AB  - The group morbidity with cryptosporidiosis (13 cases) was recorded in infants from a 
      somatic hospital and a nursery school and also among unorganized groups. The factor 
      of transmission was kefir prepared in the nursery milk kitchen. Cryptosporidian 
      oocysts were not found in the personnel of the kitchen. It was supposed that the 
      contamination of milk by oocysts occurred on milk farm. Single oocysts were found in 
      milk sediments on the filter taken from a tank at a milk factory.

TI  - Potential of Bacteria from Alternative Fermented Foods as Starter Cultures for the 
      Production of Wheat Sourdoughs.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms8101534 [doi]
LID - 1534
AB  - Microbial strains for starter culture-initiated sourdough productions are commonly 
      isolated from a fermenting flour-water mixture. Yet, starter culture strains 
      isolated from matrices other than sourdoughs could provide the dough with 
      interesting metabolic properties and hence change the organoleptic properties of the 
      concomitant breads. Furthermore, the selection of sourdough starter cultures does 
      not need to be limited to lactic acid bacteria (LAB), as other food-grade 
      microorganisms are sometimes found in sourdoughs. Therefore, different strains 
      belonging to LAB, acetic acid bacteria (AAB), and coagulase-negative staphylococci 
      (CNS) that originated from different fermented food matrices (fermenting cocoa 
      pulp-bean mass, fermented sausage, and water kefir), were examined as to their 
      prevalence in a wheat sourdough ecosystem during 72-h fermentations. 
      Limosilactobacillus fermentum IMDO 222 (fermented cocoa pulp-bean mass isolate) and 
      Latilactobacillus sakei CTC 494 (fermented sausage isolate) seemed to be promising 
      candidates as sourdough starter culture strains, as were the AAB strains Acetobacter 
      pasteurianus IMDO 386B and Gluconobacter oxydans IMDO A845 (both isolated from 
      fermented cocoa pulp-bean mass), due to their competitiveness in the wheat 
      flour-water mixtures. Wheat breads made with G. oxydans IMDO A845 sourdoughs were 
      significantly darker than reference wheat breads.

TI  - Food aversions and dietary preferences in pre-school children from Olsztyn.
PG  - 147-153
AB  - BACKGROUND: The nutrition of pre-school children often does not follow the 
      recommendations, and qualitatively and quantitatively limited selection of products 
      in the diet shapes an attitude of aversion towards new products and dishes. The risk 
      of deficiencies in many important nutrients emerges, particularly in vitamins and 
      mineral components, which can affect the psychophysical development of the child and 
      have an impact on nutritional status and health disorders in adulthood. OBJECTIVE: 
      Study of dietary preferences in pre-school children and identify possible food 
      aversions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nutritional preferences of pre-school children in 
      Olsztyn were examined using a questionnaire prepared in a graphic form, presenting 
      images of 40 food products classified into 5 groups, and the acceptance level and 
      knowledge of the product was established. RESULTS: The values of Cole’s index 
      proving the proper nutritional status of pre-school children were obtained for about 
      87% of the examined group, excessive nutrition was observed in more than 4% of the 
      examined group, about 2% of the group demonstrated obesity and mild malnutrition was 
      observed in about 7% of the examined children. A high acceptance rate of sweets and 
      fast-food products by children was observed. A high degree of preference for milk 
      was recorded, as well as traditional and cognitive aversion for kefir. In the group 
      of fruit and vegetables, both a high degree of preference and aversions to all 
      indicated vegetables and fruit were observed. Taste determined the results, with 
      high acceptance for the sweet taste and rejection or a neutral attitude towards sour 
      and bitter products. CONCLUSIONS: Food aversions, by reducing the intake of food 
      products, can result in nutritional deficiencies, affecting the psychosomatic 
      development and cognitive abilities of the child. Traditional and cognitive food 
      aversions was observed towards kefir, cheeses and most of vegetables. A high level 
      of preference was observed in relation towards sweet and fast food products and a 
      low acceptance level for selected vegetables, fruits and dairy products.

PG  - 19-29
LID - 10.1007/s12010-008-8442-6 [doi]
AB  - A gene encoding a novel (S)-specific NADH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (LK-ADH) 
      was isolated from the genomic DNA of Lactobacillus kefir DSM 20587 by thermal 
      asymmetric interlaced-polymerase chain reaction. The nucleotide sequence of 
      (S)-LK-ADH gene (adhS) was determined, which consists of an open reading frame of 
      1,044 bp, coding for 347 amino acids with a molecular mass of 37.065 kDa. After a 
      BLAST similarity search in GenBank database, the amino acid sequence of (S)-LK-ADH 
      showed some homologies to several zinc containing medium-chain alcohol 
      dehydrogenases. This novel gene was deposited into GenBank with the accession number 
      of EU877965. adhS gene was subcloned into plasmid pET-28a(+), and recombinant 
      (S)-LK-ADH was successfully expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) by 
      isopropyl-beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside induction. Purified enzyme showed a high 
      enantioselectivity in the reduction of acetophenone to (S)-phenylethanol with an ee 
      value of 99.4%. The substrate specificity and cofactor preference of recombinant 
      (S)-LK-ADH were also tested.

LID - 3009795
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regarding the increasing public health concerns about the safety of 
      foodstuffs, the current survey was designed to argue the presence of preservatives 
      (e.g., sodium benzoate (SB), potassium sorbate (PS), and natamycin) and also the 
      level of salt and fungi in 148 samples of yoghurt drink "Doogh." METHODS: The 
      enumeration of fungi and determination of salt content of samples were performed 
      according to the standard procedures. Preservative determination was performed by 
      reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection (RV-HPLC-UV). 
      RESULTS: 0.1% of the total analyzed samples was above the permitted level of Iranian 
      standard for SB (0%), while PS was not detected in any of them. Furthermore, 
      natamycin in 0.11% of the analyzed samples had more than the permissible level of 
      Iranian standard. Additionally, about 15% of the tested samples was higher than the 
      Iranian standard level for fungi (<102 CFU/mL). The average amount of salt in the 
      tested Doogh samples and also in the examined Kefir samples was significantly (P < 
      0.001) lower than the standard amount of salt (<0.8 g/100). CONCLUSION: In 
      conclusion, the quality of Doogh and Kefir samples were acceptable in terms of salt 
      content. Kefir had a significantly (P ≤ 0.001) lower amount of salt in comparison 
      with Doogh. Taken together, underlining the results of the present study, no 
      significant public health concern would exist respecting the mentioned additives.

AB  - Kefiran is a neutral polysaccharide constituted by glucose and galactose produced by 
      Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens. It is included into kefir grains and has several 
      health promoting properties. In the present work, shear and extensional properties 
      of different kefiran aqueous dispersions (0.5, 1 and 2% wt.) were assessed and 
      compared to other neutral gums commonly used in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutics 
      industries (methylcellulose, locust bean gum and guar gum). Kefiran showed shear 
      flow characteristics similar to that displayed by other representative neutral gums, 
      although it always yielded lower viscosities at a given concentration. For each gum 
      system it was possible to find a correlation between dynamic and steady shear 
      properties by a master curve including both the apparent and complex viscosities. 
      When studying extensional properties of selected gums at 2% wt. by means of a 
      capillary break-up rheometer, kefiran solutions did not show important extensional 
      properties, displaying a behaviour close the Newtonian.

AB  - The microbial diversity and community structure of three different kefir grains from 
      different parts of Brazil were examined via the combination of two 
      culture-independent methods: PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) 
      and pyrosequencing. PCR-DGGE showed Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens and Lactobacillus 
      kefiri to be the major bacterial populations in all three grains. The yeast 
      community was dominated by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Pyrosequencing produced a total 
      of 14,314 partial 16S rDNA sequence reads from the three grains. Sequence analysis 
      grouped the reads into three phyla, of which Firmicutes was dominant. Members of the 
      genus Lactobacillus were the most abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in all 
      samples, accounting for up to 96% of the sequences. OTUs belonging to other lactic 
      and acetic acid bacteria genera, such as Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Streptococcus and 
      Acetobacter, were also identified at low levels. Two of the grains showed identical 
      DGGE profiles and a similar number of OTUs, while the third sample showed the 
      highest diversity by both techniques. Pyrosequencing allowed the identification of 
      bacteria that were present in small numbers and rarely associated with the microbial 
      community of this complex ecosystem.

LID - 10.3390/antiox10111845 [doi]
LID - 1845
AB  - The fact that millions of people worldwide suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) or 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), the two most prevalent neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), 
      has been a permanent challenge to science. New tools were developed over the past 
      two decades and were immediately incorporated into routines in many laboratories, 
      but the most valuable scientific contribution was the "waking up" of the gut 
      microbiota. Disturbances in the gut microbiota, such as an imbalance in the 
      beneficial/pathogenic effects and a decrease in diversity, can result in the passage 
      of undesired chemicals and cells to the systemic circulation. Recently, the 
      potential effect of probiotics on restoring/preserving the microbiota was also 
      evaluated regarding important metabolite and vitamin production, pathogen exclusion, 
      immune system maturation, and intestinal mucosal barrier integrity. Therefore, the 
      focus of the present review is to discuss the available data and conclude what has 
      been accomplished over the past two decades. This perspective fosters program 
      development of the next steps that are necessary to obtain confirmation through 
      clinical trials on the magnitude of the effects of kefir in large samples.

TI  - Inhibitory effect of kefiran on ovalbumin-induced lung inflammation in a murine 
      model of asthma.
PG  - 1590-6
LID - 10.1007/s12272-001-2156-4 [doi]
AB  - Kefiran is a major component of kefir which is a microbial symbiont mixture that 
      produces jelly-like grains. This study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic 
      availability of kefiran on the ovalbumin-induced asthma mouse model in which airway 
      inflammation and airway hyper-responsiveness were found in the lung. BALB/c mice 
      sensitized and challenged to ovalbumin were treated intra-gastrically with kefiran 1 
      hour before the ovalbumin challenge. Kefiran significantly suppressed 
      ovalbumin-induced airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) to inhaled methacholine. 
      Administration of kefiran significantly inhibited the release of both eosinophils 
      and other inflammatory cells into bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue 
      which was measured by Diff-Quik. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-5 (IL-5) were 
      also reduced to normal levels after administration of kefiran in BAL fluid. 
      Histological studies demonstrate that kefiran substantially inhibited 
      ovalbumin-induced eosinophilia in lung tissue by H&E staining and goblet cell 
      hyperplasia in the airway by PAS staining. Taken above data, kefiran may be useful 
      for the treatment of inflammation of lung tissue and airway hyper-responsiveness in 
      a murine model and may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of allergic 
      bronchial asthma.

TI  - Co-Culture Strategy of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens HL1 for Developing Functional 
      Fermented Milk.
LID - 10.3390/foods10092098 [doi]
LID - 2098
AB  - Our previous studies indicated that Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens HL1, isolated from 
      kefir grain, has strong antioxidant activities and anti-aging effects. However, this 
      strain is difficult to use in isolation when manufacturing fermented products due to 
      poor viability in milk. Thus, the purpose of this study was to apply a co-culture 
      strategy to develop a novel probiotic fermented milk rich in L. kefiranofaciens HL1. 
      Each of four selected starter cultures was co-cultured with kefir strain HL1 in 
      different media to evaluate their effects on microbial activity and availability of 
      milk fermentation. The results of a colony size test on de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe 
      (MRS) agar agar, microbial viability, and acidification performance in MRS broth and 
      skimmed milk suggested that Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris APL15 is a suitable 
      candidate for co-culturing with HL1. We then co-cultured HL1 and APL15 in skimmed 
      milk and report remarkable improvement in fermentation ability and no negative 
      impact on the viability of strain HL1 or textural and rheological properties of the 
      milk. Through a co-culture strategy, we have improved the viability of kefir strain 
      HL1 in fermented skimmed milk products and successfully developed a novel milk 
      product with a unique flavor and sufficient probiotics.

TI  - The Efficacy of Electrospun PAN/Kefiran Nanofiber and Kefir in Mammalian Cell 
      Culture: Promotion of PC12 Cell Growth, Anti-MCF7 Breast Cancer Cells Activities, 
      and Cytokine Production of PBMC.
PG  - 717-728

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kefiran is a useful polysaccharide made of branched glucogalactose which 
      is produced by microorganisms. Here the anti-MCF-7 breast cancer cells activity of 
      kefiran and cytokine productions (IL-6) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
      treated by kefiran was studied. Also, the effect of using kefiran as a useful and 
      cost-effective scaffold in neural stem cell culture (PC12 cell culture) was 
      investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Kefiran was produced from raw milk with 0.5% fat 
      and 10 g of kefir grains. After incubation for 48 hrs at room temperature, the 
      solvent collected (crude kefiran). These samples were kept at 100°C for 1 hr (boiled 
      kefiran) and the supernatant was precipitated by ethanol (pure kefiran). Then, the 
      electrospun nanofibers, pure polyacrylonitrile (PAN), PAN/kefiran 5%, and 
      PAN/kefiran 10% were fabricated and used as scaffolds in the cell culture. The 
      structure of fabricated was studied by SEM and the cytokine production (IL-6) in 
      vitro in the cell culture supernatant of PBMC line after treatment with kefiran 
      (1mg/mL, 5 mg/mL) and kefiran-PAN 5% and 10% were carried out by enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The attachment of PC12 cells was examined by inverted 
      microscope. Also, cytotoxicity of kefiran for PC12 and MCF7 cells and morphological 
      changes of PC12 cells were evaluated by MTT and Cresyl violet staining (Nissl 
      staining) respectively. RESULTS: The mean diameter of fabricated PAN/kefiran 5% and 
      10% nanofibers were 310.2±43.97 nm. The contact angle measurement results (26.9± 1.9 
      for the pure PAN scaffold vs 12.3± 1.13 for the PAN/kefiran) revealed enhanced 
      hydrophilicity of scaffolds upon the incorporation of kefiran and PAN. Seeding of 
      PC12 cells on the scaffolds showed that fabrication of kefiran into PAN led to the 
      enhancement of cell attachment, proliferation, and morphological changes. Also, the 
      promotion of PBMC growth and decreasing of MCF7 cell lines viability were shown 
      through MTT assay. No significant changes were measured for the level of IL-6 in 
      PAN/kefiran 5% treated cells compared to the control (p ≥ 0.05). CONCLUSION: These 
      results suggest superior properties of kefiran/PAN nanofibrous scaffolds for the 
      neural stem cell culture especially for repairing injured spinal cord. Also, the 
      pure kefiran could be used for the enhancement of PBMC growth and reducing the MCF7 
      cancerous cells growth. So, using biocompatible, anti-bacterial, and anti-tumor 
      kefiran/PAN nanofibers for regenerative medicine seems promising.

TI  - [Milk raw materials from retrovirus infected cows: questions of safety and quality 
      of produced products].
PG  - 48-55
LID - 10.24411/0042-8833-2018-10041 [doi]
AB  - The questions of quality control and safety of milk raw materials has always been 
      relevant for the dairy industry. One of the most common cattle infection is bovine 
      leukemia (causative agent - BLV), which often occurs in conjunction with a closely 
      related infection -bovine immunodeficiency (causative agent - BIV). These 
      retroviruses are considered to be species-specific, so the key issue for the dairy 
      industry is the nutritional and raw value of milk of infected cows (without clinical 
      signs). Milk of infected with leukemia cows has changed physical and chemical 
      properties and microbiological parameters, but it is allowed to be processed after a 
      single pasteurization. Thus, there is a possibility of getting of the infected with 
      retroviruses cow's milk into the bulk milk, which can affect the quality of the 
      processed products. Characteristics of BlV-positive cow's milk have not yet been 
      studied. The aim of the research was the study of influence of BLV- and BLV- 
      BIV-infected cows' milk impurities (10, 30 и 50%) on organoleptic, physicochemical 
      and microbiological parameters of produced kefir drink. It is revealed that with 
      increasing the mass fraction of infected with retroviruses cows' milk, acidity of 
      composite samples increased of 1-3 °T and total viable bacteria's count rose by 1-3 
      orders of magnitude, while the total protein in milk decreased by 0.05-0.95% 
      contrasted with an increasing of milk fat content by 0.3-0.9%. However, these 
      characteristics were within normal limits. In samples containing 50% of milk 
      infected with retroviruses cows, coliforms were detected in 0.1 ml, and the rate of 
      total viable bacteria's count exceeded the permissible limits. Therefore, 
      microbiological characteristics are determination markers of dairy raw materials 
      with the high content of milk of the infected with retroviruses cows. The kefir 
      drink was produced from pasteurized samples. It was found that the acidity of the 
      product was lower by 1-10 °T, while the processing time increased by 4-50%, 
      correlating with the mass fraction of infected with retroviruses cows' milk, 
      compared to control. When the mass fraction of infected with retroviruses cows' milk 
      was 30 and 50%, the processed product had a heterogeneous consistency with flake 
      clots. At the same time, the lactic-acid-producing bacterium count in kefir drink 
      decreased by 2-3 orders, and mold and coliforms were found in it. Thus, the presence 
      more than 10% of milk from infected with retroviruses cows in raw materials leads to 
      a decrease in its technological properties, and dose 30 and 50% leads to 
      non-compliance of the processed product with hygienic standards.

TI  - Anti-Inflammatory, Antioxidant, and Antifibrotic Effects of Kefir Peptides on 
      Salt-Induced Renal Vascular Damage and Dysfunction in Aged Stroke-Prone 
      Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats.

AB  - The increased prevalence of renal dysfunction and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 
      the high costs and poor outcomes of treatment are a significant health issue. The 
      consequence of chronic high blood pressure is the increased prevalence of target 
      organ end-stage renal disease, which has been proven to be a strong independent risk 
      factor for adverse cardiovascular disease. A previous study showed that kefir 
      products have anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertensive activities and immunological 
      modulation functions. However, no data regarding the beneficial effects of kefir 
      peptides (KPs) on salt-induced renal damage or related kidney diseases are 
      available. In this study, KPs were orally administered to aged salt-induced 
      stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHRSP) rats, and the effects of KPs against 
      inflammation and oxidative stress and their ability to protect against renal 
      dysfunction were evaluated. Fifty-five-week-old SHRSP rats under induction with 1% 
      NaCl in drinking water for 4 weeks showed multiple renal injuries with increased 
      renal inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative stress, tubular atrophy, and 
      glomerulosclerosis. In contrast, oral gavage with KPs reduced the urine protein to 
      creatinine (UPC) ratio, the fractional excretion of electrolytes (FeNa and FeCl), 
      extracellular matrix deposition, and the interstitial fibrotic α-smooth muscle actin 
      (α-SMA) levels in salt-induced SHRSP rats. The renal infiltration of inflammatory 
      cells; the release of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular cell 
      adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), endothelin-1 (ET-1), and the cytokine 
      nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family pyrin domain 
      containing 3 (NLRP3) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β); the reactive oxygen 
      species (ROS) levels; and histopathological lesions were also decreased in 
      salt-induced SHRSP rats. Furthermore, KP treatment significantly increased the renal 
      superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which 
      exerted potent protection against salt-induced chronic kidney disease in SHRSP rats. 
      The results of this study suggest that KPs ameliorate salt-induced renal damage, 
      tubular atrophy, and glomerular dysfunction through anti-inflammatory, antioxidative 
      stress, and antifibrotic activities, and might be a promising protective agent 
      against high salt-induced renovascular-related diseases.

TI  - Coadjuvants in the Diabetic Complications: Nutraceuticals and Drugs with Pleiotropic 
      Effects.
LID - 10.3390/ijms17081273 [doi]
LID - 1273
AB  - Because diabetes mellitus (DM) is a multifactorial metabolic disease, its prevention 
      and treatment has been a constant challenge for basic and clinical investigators 
      focused on translating their discoveries into clinical treatment of this complex 
      disorder. In this review, we highlight recent experimental and clinical evidences of 
      potential coadjuvants in the management of DM, such as polyphenols (quercetin, 
      resveratrol and silymarin), cultured probiotic microorganisms and drugs acting 
      through direct/indirect or pleiotropic effects on glycemic control in DM. Among 
      several options, we highlight new promising therapeutic coadjuvants, including 
      chemical scavengers, the probiotic kefir and the phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, 
      which besides the reduction of hyperglycemia and ameliorate insulin resistance, they 
      reduce oxidative stress and improve endothelial dysfunction in the systemic vascular 
      circulation. In the near future, experimental studies are expected to clear the 
      intracellular pathways involving coadjuvants. The design of clinical trials may also 
      contribute to new strategies with coadjuvants against the harmful effects of 
      diabetic complications.

AB  - Microbial exopolysaccharides (EPSs) have been widely studied in recent decades due 
      to similarity to gums used in the food industry. Exopolysaccharides can be used in 
      food processing as a thickener and/or stabiliser. This study aimed to investigate 
      the physicochemical properties, thermal behaviour and structural composition of the 
      lyophilised EPS obtained from the fermentation of kefir grains in soymilk. The EPS 
      in concentration 18 mg/mL exhibited water activity of 0.204 and pH=6.20 at 25°C, 
      reducing sugars content of 22.10% (v/v) and protein content of 2% (v/v). The 
      thermogravimetric curve obtained was similar to those reported in the literature for 
      other EPSs. The degradation temperature was 351.84°C and showed that the EPS in this 
      study had a high thermal stability. Characteristic polysaccharide bands were 
      observed in the infrared spectrum. The analysis by liquid chromatography coupled to 
      electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) showed that the EPS is only 
      composed of glucose.

TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens M1 isolated from kefir grains on germ-free 
      mice.

AB  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens M1 is a novel probiotic strain that was isolated from 
      kefir grains. Previously, we have demonstrated the immunoregulatory, anti-allergic, 
      anti-asthmatic and anti-colitis abilities of L. kefiranofaciens M1 in a number of 
      in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. However, whether the effects of L. kefiranofaciens 
      M1 are elicited directly on the host or act by regulating the host's microbiota 
      remains unknown. A number of studies have used germ-free or gnotobiotic animals to 
      investigate the relationship between probiotics and colitis; therefore the aim of 
      this study was to investigate the effects of L. kefiranofaciens M1 on germ-free 
      mice. Such an approach should help in determining the direct effects of L. 
      kefiranofaciens M1 on the host itself. Four-week-old female germ-free mice were 
      inoculated intragastrically with 2×10(8) CFU/mouse L. kefiranofaciens M1 once or at 
      2-day intervals for 14 days. Bacterial colonization, the Th1/Th2 cytokine profile of 
      the mice's splenocytes and the anti-colitis effect of L. kefiranofaciens M1 were 
      investigated. The strongest response in terms of splenic Th1 cytokine IFN-γ and 
      IL-12 production upon TLR activation was detected in the continuous treatment group 
      when comparing to the single inoculation group and the germ-free control. In 
      addition, continuous inoculation with L. kefiranofaciens M1 was found to ameliorate 
      the symptoms of DSS-induced colitis in germ-free mice. However, L. kefiranofaciens 
      M1 failed to colonize the host. Thus it would seem that L. kefiranofaciens M1 is 
      likely to act directly on the host and not be involved in microbiota regulation.

AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum Lp27 was isolated from Tibetan kefir grains. The Lp27 
      isolate survived a 3-h incubation at pH 2.0 and grew normally in 0.3% oxgall. In 
      addition, the Lp27 isolate exhibited an adhesion ratio of 9.5 ± 2.5% with Caco-2 
      cells. Antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that the Lp27 isolate was sensitive 
      to gentamicin, tetracycline, erythromycin, and chloramphenicol, and was resistant to 
      vancomycin with a minimum inhibitory value of 23µg/mL. The Lp27 isolate inhibited 
      cholesterol absorption through downregulation of Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1) 
      expression in Caco-2 cells. The Lp27 isolate was fed to hypercholesterolemic rats at 
      a dose of 10(9) cfu/d for 4wk. The Lp27 feeding significantly lowered serum total 
      cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides concentrations, 
      but no change was observed in the serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
      concentrations. In addition, liver total cholesterol and triglycerides were 
      decreased in the Lp27-fed group. The expression of NPC1L1 in the duodenum and 
      jejunum was significantly decreased following Lp27 feeding. These results indicate 
      that Lp27 might be an effective cholesterol-lowering probiotic and a possible 
      mechanism for the cholesterol-reducing effects of probiotics.

TI  - Role of S-layer proteins in the biosorption capacity of lead by Lactobacillus kefir.
PG  - 583-92
LID - 10.1007/s11274-015-1812-7 [doi]
AB  - The role of S-layer proteins (SLP) on the Pb(2+) sequestrant capacity by 
      Lactobacillus kefir CIDCA 8348 and JCM 5818 was investigated. Cultures in the 
      stationary phase were treated with proteinase K. A dot blot assay was carried out to 
      assess the removal of SLP. Strains with and without SLP were exposed to 0-0.5 mM 
      Pb(NO3)2. The maximum binding capacity (q max ) and the affinity coefficient (b) 
      were calculated using the Langmuir equation. The structural effect of Pb(2+) on 
      microorganisms with and without SLP was determined using Raman spectroscopy. The 
      bacterial interaction with Pb(2+) led to a broadening in the phosphate bands 
      (1,300-1,200 cm(-1) region) and strong alterations on amide and carboxylate-related 
      bands (νCOO(-) as and νCOO(-) s). Microorganisms without SLP removed higher 
      percentages of Pb(2+) and had higher q max than those bearing SLP. Isolated SLP had 
      much lower q max and also removed lower percentages of Pb(2+) than the corresponding 
      whole microorganisms. The hydrofobicity of both strains dramatically dropped when 
      removing SLP. When bearing SLP, strains do not expose a large amount of charged 
      groups on their surfaces, thus making less efficient the Pb(2+) removal. On the 
      contrary, the extremely low hydrofobicity of microorganisms without SLP (and 
      consequently, their higher capacity to remove Pb(2+)) can be explained on the basis 
      of a greater exposure of charged chemical groups for the interaction with Pb(2+). 
      The viability of bacteria without SLP was not significantly lower than that of 
      bacteria bearing SLP. However, microorganisms without SLP were more prone to the

AB  - The alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) from Lactobacillus kefir and Rhodococcus sp., 
      which earlier turned out to be suitable for a chemoenzymatic one-pot synthesis with 
      organocatalysts, were immobilized with their cofactors on a commercially available 
      superabsorber based on a literature known protocol. The use of the immobilized ADH 
      from L. kefir in the reduction of acetophenone as a model substrate led to high 
      conversion (>95%) in the first reaction cycle, followed by a slight decrease of 
      conversion in the second reaction cycle. A comparable result was obtained when no 
      cofactor was added although a water rich reaction media was used. The immobilized 
      ADHs also turned out to be suitable catalysts for the diastereoselective reduction 
      of an organocatalytically prepared enantiomerically enriched aldol adduct, leading 
      to high conversion, diastereomeric ratio and enantioselectivity for the resulting 
      1,3-diols. However, at a lower catalyst and cofactor amount being still sufficient 
      for biotransformations with "free" enzymes the immobilized ADH only showed high 
      conversion and >99% ee for the first reaction cycle whereas a strong decrease of 
      conversion was observed already in the second reaction cycle, thus indicating a 
      significant leaching effect of catalyst and/or cofactor.

AB  - Elevated blood cholesterol is an important risk factor associated with 
      atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. The search for mediators that fine-tune 
      cholesterol homeostasis has revealed lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to be potentially 
      beneficial. The aim of the present study was to identify and characterize probiotic 
      strains with bile salt hydrolase activity from kefir grains and evaluate their 
      potential use as cholesterol-reducing probiotics in rats. Two isolates, Lp09 and 
      Lp45, obtained from kefir grains were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum via 
      molecular typing methods. Lactobacillus plantarum Lp09 and Lp45 exhibited excellent 
      tolerance to low pH levels and high bile salt concentrations and showed potential 
      bile salt hydrolase activity, bile salt deconjugation activity, and cholesterol 
      coprecipitation ability. Additionally, the potential effect of Lb. plantarum Lp09 
      and Lp45 on plasma cholesterol levels was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats in 
      3 treatment groups were fed different experimental diets: a high-cholesterol diet, a 
      high-cholesterol diet plus Lb. plantarum Lp09, or a high-cholesterol diet plus Lb. 
      plantarum Lp45 for 4 wk. Total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol levels in serum as well as cholesterol and triglyceride 
      levels in liver were significantly decreased in the LAB-treated rats compared with 
      rats fed a high-cholesterol diet without LAB supplementation. Also, both fecal 
      cholesterol and bile acid levels were significantly increased after LAB 
      administration. No significant changes were detected in high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol levels. These results suggest that the Lb. plantarum Lp09 and Lp45 
      strains present the potential to be explored as probiotic agents for the management 
      of hypercholesterolemia.

AB  - Inflammation is a physiological response to infections and tissue injury; however, 
      abnormal immune responses can give rise to chronic inflammation and contribute to 
      disease progression. Various dietary components, including probiotic lactic acid 
      bacteria and prebiotics, have the potential to modulate intestinal inflammatory 
      responses. One factor in particular, the chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8, CXCL-8), is 
      one of the major mediators of the inflammatory response. The purpose of this study 
      was to investigate modulation of the inflammatory host response induced by 
      Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT104 in the presence of selected probiotics 
      and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from human sources, dairy products, and farm 
      animals. IL-8 gene expression and protein production in HT-29 cells were evaluated 
      by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Pre-incubation of HT-29 cells with 
      Lactobacillus kefir IM002, Bifidobacterium adolescentis FRP 61, Bifidobacterium 
      longum FRP 68 and FRP 69, Bifidobacterium breve FRP 334, and Leuconostoc 
      mesenteroides IM080 significantly inhibited IL-8 secretion induced by Salmonella 
      Typhimurium DT104. Co-culture of selected probiotics and Salmonella Typhimurium 
      DT104 reduced IL-8 production, while potential probiotics and LAB had no effect on 
      IL-8 secretion in HT-29 cells preincubated with Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 prior 
      to adding probiotics. Lactobacillus kefir IM002 supernatant also significantly 
      reduced IL-8 production. In conclusion, our study suggests that probiotic 
      bifidobacteria and LAB modulate cytokine induction and possess anti-inflammatory 
      properties; however, the effectiveness is strain dependent.

PG  - 3711-3722
LID - 10.2174/1381612826666200331084338 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction is commonly present in estrogen-deficient 
      states, e.g., after menopause. In the search for alternatives to hormone replacement 
      therapy (HRT), treatments based on phytoestrogens or in non-hormonal mechanisms have 
      been under evaluation. OBJECTIVE: Here we aim to present an overview of innovative 
      potential treatments for endothelial dysfunction in estrogen-deficient states, 
      introducing our own preliminary data about the probiotic kefir. METHODS: We 
      conducted a review based on a PubMed database search for keywords of interest 
      (Menopause, Ovariectomy, Vascular dysfunction, Hot flashes, Metformin, Statins, 
      Phytoestrogens, Omega-3, Vitamin D, Probiotics). RESULTS: Vascular parameters were 
      found to be improved by both metformin and statins through pleiotropic effects, 
      being related to a decrease in oxidative stress and restoration of the nitric oxide 
      pathway. Phytoestrogens such as genistein and resveratrol have also been shown to 
      improve vascular dysfunction, which seems to involve their estrogenic-like actions. 
      Omega-3, vitamin D and its analogues, as well as probiotics, have shown similar 
      vascular beneficial effects in both postmenopausal women and an animal model of 
      ovariectomy (OVX), which could be related to antioxidant and/or anti-inflammatory 
      effects. Moreover, our preliminary data on the probiotic kefir treatment in OVX rats 
      suggested a vascular antioxidant effect. In particular, some evidence points to 
      statins and vitamin D having anti-atherogenic effects. CONCLUSION: Pleiotropic 
      effects of common medications and natural compounds could have therapeutic potential 
      for endothelial dysfunction in estrogen-deficient states. They could, therefore, 
      work as future complementary or alternative treatments to HRT.

TI  - The Combined Effect of Pressure and Temperature on Kefir Production-A Case Study of 
      Food Fermentation in Unconventional Conditions.
LID - 10.3390/foods9081133 [doi]
LID - 1133
AB  - Food fermentation under pressure has been studied in recent years as a way to 
      produce foods with novel properties. The purpose of this work was to study kefir 
      production under pressure (7-50 MPa) at different temperatures (17-32 °C), as a case 
      study of unconventional food fermentation. The fermentation time to produce kefir 
      was similar at all temperatures (17, 25, and 32 °C) up to 15 MPa, compared to 
      atmospheric pressure. At 50 MPa, the fermentation rate was slower, but the 
      difference was reduced as temperature increased. During fermentation, lactic and 
      acetic acid concentration increased while citric acid decreased. The positive 
      activation volumes (Va) obtained indicate that pressure decreased the fermentation 
      rate, while the temperature rise led to the attenuation of the pressure effect 
      (lower Va). On the other hand, higher activation energies (Ea) were observed with 
      pressure increase, indicating that fermentation became more sensitive to 
      temperature. The condition that resulted in a faster fermentation, higher titratable 
      acidity, and higher concentration of lactic acid was 15 MPa/32 °C. As the authors 
      are aware, this is the second work in the literature to study the combined effect of 
      pressure and temperature on a fermentative process.

TI  - Gelling ability of kefiran in the presence of sucrose and fructose and 
      physicochemical characterization of the resulting cryogels.
PG  - 5039-47

AB  - In this work, the influence of sucrose and fructose on the gel-forming capacity of 
      kefiran was investigated as well as the physicochemical characteristics of the 
      resulting gels. The addition of sugar to gel-forming solutions did not alter the 
      pseudoplastic flow properties of kefiran solutions and after one freeze-thaw cycle 
      translucent gels with high water-holding capability were obtained. A highly porous 
      matrix was revealed by microscopy whose pore size varied with sugar concentration. 
      Sucrose and fructose had different effects on the rheological characteristics of 
      sugar-kefiran gels. An increment in the strength of the gels with progressive 
      concentrations of sucrose was evidenced by an increase in the elastic modulus (G'), 
      indicating that sucrose reinforces the binding interactions between the polymer 
      molecules (p ≤ 0.05). A drastic reduction in elastic modulus occurred, however, when 
      50.0 % w/w sucrose was added to kefiran gels, resulting in less elasticity. In 
      contrast, when fructose was added to kefiran gels, elastic modulus decreased 
      slightly with progressive sugar concentrations up to 10 %, thereafter increasing up 
      to 50 % (p ≤ 0.05). Supplementation with up to 30 % sugar contributed to water 
      retention and increased the viscous modulus. The relative increment in the elastic 
      and viscous moduli elevated the loss tangent (tanδ) depending on the type and 
      concentration of sugar. Sugars (sucrose, fructose) present in the matrix of the 
      polysaccharide networks modified water-polymer and polymer-polymer interactions and 
      consequently changed the gels' physicochemical characteristics, thus allowing the 
      possibility of selecting the appropriate formulation through tailor-made kefiran 
      cryogels.

TI  - Fine structure of Tibetan kefir grains and their yeast distribution, diversity, and 
      shift.

AB  - Tibetan kefir grains (TKGs), a kind of natural starter for fermented milk in Tibet, 
      China, host various microorganisms of lactic acid bacteria, yeasts, and occasionally 
      acetic acid bacteria in a polysaccharide/protein matrix. In the present study, the 
      fine structure of TKGs was studied to shed light on this unusual symbiosis with 
      stereomicroscopy and thin sections. The results reveal that TKGs consist of numerous 
      small grain units, which are characterized by a hollow globular structure with a 
      diameter between 2.0 and 9.0 mm and a wall thickness of approximately 200 µm. A 
      polyhedron-like net structure, formed mainly by the bacteria, was observed in the 
      wall of the grain units, which has not been reported previously to our knowledge. 
      Towards the inside of the grain unit, the polyhedron-like net structures became 
      gradually larger in diameter and fewer in number. Such fine structures may play a 
      crucial role in the stability of the grains. Subsequently, the distribution, 
      diversity, and shift of yeasts in TKGs were investigated based on thin section, 
      scanning electron microscopy, cloning and sequencing of D1/D2 of the 26S rRNA gene, 
      real-time quantitative PCR, and in situ hybridization with specific 
      fluorescence-labeled oligonucleotide probes. These show that (i) yeasts appear to 
      localize on the outer surface of the grains and grow normally together to form 
      colonies embedded in the bacterial community; (ii) the diversity of yeasts is 
      relatively low on genus level with three dominant species--Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 
      Kluyveromyces marxianus, and Yarrowia lipolytica; (iii) S. cerevisiae is the stable 
      predominant yeast species, while the composition of Kluyveromyces and Yarrowia are 
      subject to change over time. Our results indicate that TKGs are relatively stable in 
      structure, and culture conditions to some extent shape the microbial community and 
      interaction in kefir grains. These findings pave the way for further study of the 
      specific symbiotic associations between S. cerevisiae and Lactobacillus bacteria in 
      TKGs.

TI  - Probiotics: current trends in the treatment of diarrhoea.
PG  - 213-8
AB  - In recent years, research into and public interest in probiotics and probiotic foods 
      have risen. Lactobacilli and bifidobacterium are the most commonly used probiotics 
      while yoghurt and kefir are popular foods containing probiotics. Probiotics have 
      been used to manage diarrhoea. Many things cause diarrhoea, including bacterial, 
      viral and protozoal infections, radiation and antibiotic therapy. Different studies 
      have found that probiotics may also enhance the immune response, reduce serum 
      cholesterol, prevent colonic cancer, prevent dental caries, prevent ulcers due to 
      Helicobacter pylori, maintain urogenital health, and ameliorate hepatic 
      encephalopathy. Further studies are required to establish their role in these 
      conditions.

TI  - Treatment of in vitro enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection using phage and 
      probiotics.
PG  - 78-88
LID - 10.1111/jam.13124 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To assay the combination of phage and probiotics against EHEC in vitro on 
      infected Hep-2 cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: Phage and probiotics treatments on EHEC 
      O157:H7-infected Hep-2 cells were assayed individually or combined. The effect of 
      freeze-drying on phage and probiotic antimicrobial activity was also studied. While 
      treatment with phage alone increased cell detachment caused by EHEC infection, the 
      treatments with MM alone or in combination with phage proved to effectively diminish 
      cell damage caused by EHEC infection. Combined treatment showed a decrease in 
      apoptotic cell count of 57·3% and a reduction in EHEC adhesion to cell monolayer of 
      1·2 log CFU. The simultaneous use of phage and probiotics showed no antagonistic 
      effect, and freeze-drying did not affect their antipathogenic activity. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The combination of phage and probiotics has great potential for reducing the number 
      of pathogens adhered to epithelial cells during EHEC O157:H7 infection and 
      attenuating the cytotoxic effect derived from it. Further in vivo assays are needed 
      for assessing the actual effectiveness of the treatment. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF 
      THE STUDY: This study presents a freeze-dried formulation of phage and probiotics 
      capable of controlling EHEC infections and reducing epithelial cell damage in vitro.

AB  - A two-strain starter culture containing Lactobacillus plantarum CIDCA 83114, a 
      potential probiotic strain isolated from kefir grains, and Streptococcus 
      thermophilus CIDCA 321 was tested for the preparation of a fermented milk product. 
      Kluyveromyces marxianus CIDCA 8154, a yeast with immunomodulatory properties was 
      included to formulate a three-strain starter culture. Supernatants of 
      enterohaemorragic Escherichia coli, shiga-toxin-producing strain, along with a 
      two-strain or a three-strain starter culture were included in the medium of 
      Vero-cell surface cultures. The results demonstrated that these combinations of 
      microorganisms antagonize the cytopathic action of shiga toxins. The cell 
      concentration of Lb. plantarum did not decrease during fermentation, indicating that 
      the viability of this strain was not affected by low pH, nor did the number of 
      viable bacteria change during 21 days of storage in either fermented products. The 
      number of viable yeasts increases during fermentation and storage. Trained assessors 
      analyzed the general acceptability of fresh fermented milks and considered both 
      acceptable. The milk fermented with the two-strain starter culture was considered 
      acceptable after two week of storage, while the product fermented with the 
      three-strain starter culture remained acceptable for less than one week. The main 
      changes in sensory attributes detected by the trained panel were in sour taste, 
      milky taste and also in fermented attributes. The correlation between different 
      sensory attributes and acceptability indicated that the panel was positively 
      influenced by milky attributes (taste, odour, and flavour) as well as the intensity 
      of flavour. In conclusion, the two-strain starter culture would be the more 
      promising alternative for inclusion of that potential probiotic lactobacillus in a 
      fermented milk product.

AB  - From 70 to 90% of premature infants on breast and additional feeding with a mixture 
      of the "Similak" type showed normal bifidoflora, the main component of biocenosis of 
      infant intestines. No positive shifts in the intestinal microflora composition or 
      recovery of the bifidoflora physiological for children were recorded during feeding 
      premature infants with pasteurized donor milk and additional feeding with kefir, a 
      mixture of "Malyutka" and dry acidophilus mixture "Malyutka". Positive results of 
      using the above food in conjunction with bifidumbacterin point to the 
      perspectiveness of using bifidobacteria in the development of therapeutic additives 
      to the infant diet.

TI  - Use of kefir peptide (Kef-1) as an emerging approach for the treatment of oxidative 
      stress and inflammation in 2K1C mice.
LID - 10.1039/d1fo01798e [doi]
AB  - The benefits of kefir consumption are partially due to the rich composition of 
      bioactive molecules released from its fermentation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 
      (ACE) inhibitors are bioactive molecules with potential use in the treatment or 
      prevention of hypertension, heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Here, the in 
      vivo actions of the Kef-1 peptide, an ACE inhibitor derived from kefir, were 
      evaluated in an angiotensin II-dependent hypertension model. The Kef-1 peptide 
      showed a potential anti-hypertensive effect. Additionally, Kef-1 exhibited systemic 
      antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. In smooth muscle cells (SMCs), the 
      Kef-1 peptide decreased ROS production through the reduced participation of NADPH 
      oxidase and mitochondria. The aorta of 2K1C mice treated with Kef-1 showed lesser 
      wall-thickening and partial restoration of the endothelial structure. In conclusion, 
      these novel findings highlight the in vivo biological potential of this peptide 
      demonstrating that Kef-1 may be a relevant nutraceutical treatment for 
      cardiovascular diseases.

      The utilization of 18 specific carbon compounds was estimated in the investigation 
      of each strains for differentiation of the species. From among 125 strains of fungi 
      the following were found: Candida albicans (112 strain), C. famata (2), C. glabrata 
      (1), C. guilliermondii (1), C. kefir (4), C. tropicalis (2). The activity of 19 
      hydrolases was investigated using API ZYM. Biotyping of Candida strains was done 
      according to the Williamson classification (1986), modified by Kurnatowska (1998). 
      All strains were isolated from the oral cavity, rectum, as well as from the 
      materials collected during endoscopy in children.

AB  - Fermented milks (yogurt, kefir, sour milk), compared with milk for their non-protein 
      nitrogen and free amino-nitrogen contents gave higher values prior to as well as 1, 
      2 and 3 h after pepsin digestion in vitro. In feeding trials of 6 weeks duration 
      with diets based on casein, milk and fermented milks, respectively, those groups of 
      weanling (50 to 60 g) male Wistar rats showed the maximum increments of body mass 
      which had been fed the diets based on fermented milks. The highest values of the 
      protein utilization index (increase in body mass in g per protein intake in g) were 
      found in the animals kept on the fermented milk products. The favourable protein 
      utilization and body mass increment on fermented milk diets are attributed to a 
      better digestibility of proteins in these products.

TI  - Enhancement of Insulin/PI3K/Akt Signaling Pathway and Modulation of Gut Microbiome 
      by Probiotics Fermentation Technology, a Kefir Grain Product, in Sporadic 
      Alzheimer's Disease Model in Mice.
PG  - 666502
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2021.666502 [doi]
LID - 666502
AB  - Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder with 
      cognitive dysfunction. Remarkably, alteration in the gut microbiome and resultant 
      insulin resistance has been shown to be connected to metabolic syndrome, the crucial 
      risk factor for AD, and also to be implicated in AD pathogenesis. Thus, this study, 
      we assessed the efficiency of probiotics fermentation technology (PFT), a kefir 
      product, in enhancing insulin signaling via modulation of gut microbiota to halt the 
      development of AD. We also compared its effectiveness to that of pioglitazone, an 
      insulin sensitizer that has been confirmed to substantially treat AD. AD was induced 
      in mice by a single injection of intracerebroventricular streptozotocin (STZ; 
      3 mg/kg). PFT (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) and pioglitazone (30 mg/kg) were administered 
      orally for 3 weeks. Behavioral tests were conducted to assess cognitive function, 
      and hippocampal levels of acetylcholine (Ach) and β-amyloid (Aβ(1-42)) protein were 
      assessed along with histological examination. Moreover, the expression of the 
      insulin receptor, insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), and the phosphorylated forms of 
      phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (Akt), glycogen synthase 
      kinase-3β (GSK-3β), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and tau were detected. 
      Furthermore, oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers were estimated. Treatment 
      with PFT reversed STZ-induced neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment, enhanced 
      hippocampal Ach levels, and reduced Aβ(1-42) levels after restoration of IDE 
      activity. PFT also improved insulin signaling, as evidenced by upregulation of 
      insulin receptor expression and activation of PI3K/Akt signaling with subsequent 
      suppression of GSK-3β and mTOR signaling, which result in the downregulation of 
      hyperphosphorylated tau. Moreover, PFT significantly diminished oxidative stress and 
      inflammation induced by STZ. These potential effects were parallel to those produced 
      by pioglitazone. Therefore, PFT targets multiple mechanisms incorporated in the 
      pathogenesis of AD and hence might be a beneficial therapy for AD.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by cognitive 
      impairment. Gut microbiota dysfunction (dysbiosis) is implicated in the pathology of 
      AD and is associated with several detrimental consequences, including 
      neurotransmitter depletion, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and insulin 
      resistance, which all contribute to the onset of AD. The objective of this study was 
      to assess the effectiveness of Probiotics Fermentation Technology (PFT), a kefir 
      product, in alleviating AD symptoms via regulation of the gut microbiota using a 
      streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced AD mouse model and to compare its activity with 
      simvastatin, which has been proven to effectively treat AD. Mice received one 
      intracerebroventricular injection of STZ (3 mg/kg). PFT (100, 300, 600 mg/kg) and 
      simvastatin (20 mg/kg) were administered orally for 3 weeks. PFT supplementation 
      mitigated STZ-induced neuronal degeneration in the cortex and hippocampus, restored 
      hippocampal acetylcholine levels, and improved cognition in a dose-dependent manner. 
      These effects were accompanied by reductions in oxidative damage, proinflammatory 
      cytokine expression, apoptosis, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, PFT hindered 
      amyloid plaque accumulation via the enhancement of insulin-degrading enzyme. These 
      beneficial effects were comparable to those produced by simvastatin. The results 
      suggest that PFT can alleviate AD symptoms by regulating the gut microbiota and by 
      inhibiting AD-related pathological events.

AB  - We examined the apoptotic effect of a novel Probiotics Fermentation Technology (PFT) 
      kefir grain product; PFT is a natural mixture composed primarily of Lactobacillus 
      kefiri P-IF, a specific strain of L. kefiri with unique growth characteristics. The 
      aim of this study was to examine the apoptotic effect of PFT on human 
      multidrug-resistant (MDR) myeloid leukemia (HL60/AR) cells in vitro and explore the 
      mechanistic approach underlying its effect. HL60/AR cells were cultured with PFT 
      (0.6-5.0 mg/ml) for 3 days. The apoptotic effect of PFT was assessed through 
      examination of percent apoptosis, caspase 3 activation, Bcl-2 expression levels and 
      changes in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). PFT induced apoptosis in HL60/AR 
      cells in a dose-dependent manner which was maximal at 67.5% for 5 mg/ml. Induction 
      of apoptosis was associated with activation of caspase 3, decreased expression of 
      Bcl-2 and decreased polarization of MMP. In addition, PFT showed a unique 
      characteristic of piercing holes in HL60/AR cells, as indicated by AFM studies. This 
      hole induction may be responsible for the apoptotic effect on cancer cells. These 
      results suggest that PFT may act as a potential therapy for the treatment of MDR 
      leukemia.

AB  - Diastereoselective reduction of diketones with Lactobacillus kefir DSM 20587 was 
      examined. The reduction of both oxo-functions proceeded highly diastereoselectively. 
      (2 R,5 R)-Hexanediol 3 was produced starting from (2,5)-hexanedione 1 in 
      quantitative yields with enantiomeric excess >99% and diastereomeric excess >99%. 
      The reaction conditions were optimized: maximum yield of (2 R,5 R)-hexanediol was 
      reached at pH 6, 30 degrees C and with equal amounts of substrate and cosubstrate. 
      The applicability of the system in fed-batch experiments was demonstrated. The feed 
      specific biomass concentration required to reach maximal yield and selectivity in 
      fed-batch mode was determined.

AB  - With the end of the golden era of antibiotic discovery, the emergence of a new 
      post-antibiotic age threatens to thrust global health and modern medicine back to 
      the pre-antibiotic era. Antibiotic overuse has resulted in the natural evolution and 
      selection of multi-drug resistant bacteria. One major public health threat, 
      Clostridium difficile, is now the single leading cause of hospital-acquired 
      bacterial infections and is by far the most deadly enteric pathogen for the U.S. 
      POPULATION: Due to the high morbidity and mortality and increasing incidence that 
      coincides with antibiotic use, non-traditional therapeutics are ideal alternatives 
      to current treatment methods and also provide an avenue towards prevention. Despite 
      the need for alternative therapies to antibiotics and the safety of most probiotics 
      on the market, researchers are inundated with regulatory issues that hinder the 
      translational science required to push these therapies forward. This review 
      discusses the regulatory challenges of probiotic research, expert opinion regarding 
      the application of probiotics to C. difficile infection and the efficacy of 
      probiotics in preventing this disease.

AB  - Background/Objective: Various dietary factors, including the daily food intake 
      during pregnancy and lactation can play a role in the development of lactational 
      mastitis (LM). To investigate the effect of the most commonly consumed fermented 
      foods (FF) during pregnancy and lactation in Turkey and other factors described in 
      the literature regarding childbirth and breastfeeding on the development of LM. 
      Materials and Methods: The study included 607 volunteers in the lactational period, 
      of whom 303 had LM and 304 had no mastitis event. The data on sociodemographics, 
      childbirth, and breastfeeding, and the consumption frequency of six types of FF were 
      collected through a face-to-face questionnaire. Results: The variables significantly 
      and independently associated with LM were birth week (odds ratio [OR] = 80.83, 95% 
      confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-1.94), birth weight (OR = 0.63, CI: 1.24-1.79), time 
      to breastfeeding after birth (OR = 0.79, CI: 1.62-2.31), breastfeeding length 
      (OR = 0.12, CI: 2.25-2.78), breast preference (OR = 0.13, CI: 2.83-3.42), use of 
      cream on nipples (OR = 0.81, CI: 1.31-1.97), use of oral probiotics (OR = 0.29, CI: 
      1.86-2.92), and receiving breastfeeding education from an expert (OR = 0.22, CI: 
      1.22-2.34). According to the multinominal logistic regression analysis, the daily 
      consumption of kefir (OR = 0.69, CI: 1.18-2.22), homemade yogurt (OR = 0.78, CI: 
      1.14-1.87), conventional yogurt (OR = 0.81, CI: 1.24-2.46), boza (OR = 0.79, CI: 
      2.19-2.99), tarhana (OR = 0.52, CI: 2.47-2.81), and pickles (OR = 0.22, CI: 
      1.22-2.34) significantly reduced the risk of LM development. The diversity of 
      consumed FF was also found to be protective against LM (OR = 0.34, CI: 1.34-2.35). 
      Conclusion: Kefir, homemade and conventional yogurt, boza, tarhana, and pickles can 
      protect breastfeeding mothers and also reduce the risk of LM development.

AB  - This study investigated the use of kefir, yogurt and their combination in the 
      production of wet tarhana with an aim to increase the nutritional value of the end 
      product. Along with microbiological and chemical properties, the volatile compound 
      composition of wet tarhana was also evaluated. Wet tarhana revealed an increase in 
      the lactic acid bacteria count (LAB) with the addition of kefir. After fermentation, 
      counts of total yeast, LAB, and total mesophilic aerobic bacteria were 7.57, 8.26 
      and 7.64 log CFU/g, respectively. The values of pH and titratable acidity were 
      measured as 4.78 and 4.68% in terms of lactic acid, respectively, at the end of 
      fermentation. Lactic acid content increased from 3.31 to 10.82 g/kg throughout 
      fermentation. A total of 72 volatile compounds were recorded during fermentation and 
      44 of these were identified by GC-MS. The most abundant compounds identified in the 
      tarhana samples were hexadecanoic acid and 9,12-octadecadienoic acid. Moreover, ABTS 
      antioxidant activity results of all formulations were measured in the range of 15.86 
      and 19.31 µmol TE/g at the end of fermentation and it was independent of the 
      fermentation period.

TI  - [Multiplication of Listeria in milk products].
PG  - 80-1
AB  - The results of the evaluation of the multiplication dynamics of Listeria cells in 
      milk and Bifidok, a lactic acid product, are presented. The samples were inoculated 
      on thioglycol agar and studied at different exposure time after incubation at 37 
      degrees C, 20 degrees C and 4 degrees C. The study revealed the intensive 
      multiplication of Listeria cells in milk, also during storage in a household 
      refrigerator. The presence of bifidobacteria mixed with kefir-producing culture in 
      dairy products was shown to essentially inhibit the growth of Listeria cells which 
      were not detected by bacteriological techniques on day 7.

TI  - Protection against an infectious disease by enterohaemorrhagic E. coli 0-157.
PG  - 87-8
AB  - Preventive measures against infection by enterohaemorrhagic E. coli 0-157 are 
      described. Eating yoghurt and Kefir supposedly induces more bifid bacteria and 
      lactic acid bacteria to colonize in the intestines, thereby protecting humans from 
      infection by E. coli 0-157. Some foods, such as plum extract, act as a mild 
      antibiotic and produce an acidic environment within the intestine, thus interfering 
      with growth of the E. coli 0-157. The natural colonization of harmless E. coli or 
      other bacteria that are more powerful than E. coli 0-157 can possibly protect 
      against infection. A vaccination against E. coli 0-157 H7 may also be effective. In 
      addition, it has been suggested that the correct levels of nitric oxide and calcium 
      in the blood may activate immunity and protect against infection by E. coli 0-157.

TI  - Traditional Bulgarian Dairy Products: Ethnic Foods with Health Benefits.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms9030480 [doi]
LID - 480
AB  - The reported health effects of fermented dairy foods, which are traditionally 
      manufactured in Bulgaria, are connected with their microbial biodiversity. The 
      screening and development of probiotic starters for dairy products with unique 
      properties are based exclusively on the isolation and characterization of lactic 
      acid bacterial (LAB) strains. This study aims to systematically describe the LAB 
      microbial content of artisanal products such as Bulgarian-type yoghurt, white brined 
      cheese, kashkaval, koumiss, kefir, katak, and the Rhodope's brano mliako. The 
      original technologies for their preparation preserve the valuable microbial content 
      and improve their nutritional and probiotic qualities. This review emphasises the 
      features of LAB starters and the autochthonous microflora, the biochemistry of dairy 
      food production, and the approaches for achieving the fortification of the foods 
      with prebiotics, bioactive peptides (ACE2-inhibitors, bacteriocins, cyclic peptides 
      with antimicrobial activity), immunomodulatory exopolysaccharides, and other 
      metabolites (indol-3-propionic acid, free amino acids, antioxidants, prebiotics) 
      with reported beneficial effects on human health. The link between the microbial 
      content of dairy foods and the healthy human microbiome is highlighted.

TI  - Measurement of Food Losses in a Hungarian Dairy Processing Plant.
LID - 10.3390/foods10020229 [doi]
LID - 229
AB  - The phenomenon of food waste and food loss at any stage of the supply chain is 
      significant in developed economies. The purpose of this article is to highlight the 
      areas of milk processing where milk loss occurs, and, after quantifying the data 
      obtained, reveal the extent of the losses. To achieve the goals, we conducted 
      on-site visits to one of Hungary's milk processors. The methodology is based on the 
      Food Loss and Waste (FLW) standard, accordingly we determined the extent of milk 
      loss at the company level, supplemented with loss values by each dairy product. 
      During the analyzed processing stages (receiving of raw milk, skimming, 
      pasteurization, Extended Shelf-Life (ESL) milk, cheese milk, sour cream, yoghurt, 
      and kefir) 1203.4-1406.8 L of raw material per day can be accounted as losses, which 
      makes up 0.9-1% of daily production. A Milk Production-Milk Losses (MPML) model was 
      created where six factors (technology and automation, design of the plant aspects, 
      quantity of orders, expertise of employees, number of product variants, optimal 
      storage capacity) were methodized that significantly influence the rate of milk 
      losses over different time periods. Our paper highlights how areas of the production 
      stage can be developed to decrease milk loss.

AB  - Gioddu, also known as "Miciuratu", "Mezzoraddu" or "Latte ischidu" (literally 
      meaning acidulous milk), is the sole variety of traditional Italian fermented milk. 
      The aim of the present study was to elucidate the microbiota and the mycobiota 
      occurring in artisan Gioddu sampled from three Sardinian producers by combining the 
      results of viable counting on selective culture media and high-throughput 
      sequencing. Physico-chemical parameters were also measured. The overall low pH 
      values (3.80-4.22) recorded in the analyzed Gioddu samples attested the strong 
      acidifying activity carried out by lactic acid bacteria during fermentation. Viable 
      counts revealed the presence of presumptive lactococci, presumptive lactobacilli and 
      non-Saccharomyces yeasts. A complex (kefir-like) microbiota of bacteria and yeasts 
      was unveiled through sequencing. In more detail, Lactobacillus delbrueckii was found 
      to dominate in Gioddu together with Streptococcus thermophilus, thus suggesting the 
      establishment of a yogurt-like protocooperation. Unexpectedly, in all the three 
      analyzed batches from two out of the three producers Lactobacillus kefiri was also 
      detected, thus representing an absolute novelty, which suggests the presence of 
      bioactive compounds (e.g. exopolysaccharides) similar to those characterizing milk 
      kefir beverage. Mycobiota population, studied for the very first time in Gioddu, 
      revealed a more complex composition, with Kluyveromyces marxianus, Galactomyces 
      candidum and Geotrichum galactomyces constituting the core species. Further research 
      is needed to disclose the eventual occurence in Gioddu of probiotic cultures and 
      bioactive compounds (e.g. exopolysaccharides, angiotensin-converting enzyme 
      inhibitory peptides and antimicrobial compounds) with potential health-benefits for 
      the consumers.

TI  - Assessment of nutritional behaviours of children aged 7-12 attending to primary 
      schools in Biala Podlaska, Poland.
PG  - 71-77
AB  - BACKGROUND: Children and youth constitute a group that is particularly prone to the 
      effects of improper diet. In the puberty period, numerous significant lifestyle 
      choices are made, for instance regarding particular nutritional behaviours which may 
      be repeated later in life and may determine the state of health. OBJECTIVE: The aim 
      of the study was to assess nutritional behaviours of children aged 7-12 attending to 
      primary schools in Biala Podlaska county (Eastern Region of Poland). MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: The study included 1643 children aged 7-12 from primary schools in Biala 
      Podlaska county. The research was carried out in 2015. The questions included in the 
      questionnaire prepared by the authors regarded the number and regularity of meals, 
      the types of products (mainly fruit and vegetables, sweets, fizzy drinks, fast food, 
      milk and dairy products) and the frequency of consuming them during these meals and 
      between them. Differences between the responses to the questions in groups divided 
      according to gender were analysed with the use of χ2 test (G function). RESULTS: It 
      was revealed that 672 girls (81.7%) and 633 boys (71.9%) had at least four meals a 
      day, while as many as 23% of the girls and boys did not have breakfast before going 
      to school and 33.5% of the girls and 37.4% of the boys did not take lunch to school. 
      The main meal (dinner) was eaten every day by 652 girls (78.5%) and 605 boys 
      (74.5%). Products most commonly eaten between the main meals were fruit and 
      vegetables (51% of the girls and 42.4% of the boys), while sweets were consumed 2-3 
      times a week by 37.2% of the girls and 36.1% of the boys. The consumption of dairy 
      products (milk, natural yoghurt and/or kefir) once a week or less frequently was 
      declared by 53% of the girls and boys. CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of nutritional 
      behaviours revealed numerous mistakes which may negatively affect the development of 
      the study participants. In the light of the above findings, it seems necessary to 
      provide children and their parents with nutritional education in order to develop 
      proper nutritional behaviours and correct the mistakes.

TI  - Effect of fermented milk diets on regeneration of the rat liver.
PG  - 163-9
AB  - In a comparative study of milk versus fermented milk (yogurt, kefir, sour milk) 
      diets concerning their effect on body mass and on liver regeneration in partially 
      (70%) hepatectomized male CFY rats significantly higher values were found three 
      weeks after the operation in the groups fed on fermented milk diets than in those 
      fed on milk-based diets. No differences between the chemical components of the 
      regenerated liver (solids, total lipids, total N) were found either between the 
      individual groups, or between the various groups and the control. The regenerated 
      liver corresponded to the normal organ in every respect. The values reflecting the 
      increments of solids, total lipids and total N of the regenerating liver, whether 
      expressed in absolute figures or in per cents, were found to be higher in the 
      animals fed fermented milk diets than in those fed milk-based diets. The invention 
      that the biochemical changes associated with bacterial fermentation of milk are 
      beneficial to liver regeneration provides new evidence in support of the high 
      biological nutritive value of fermentation.

TI  - A Lactobacillus plantarum strain isolated from kefir protects against intestinal 
      infection with Yersinia enterocolitica O9 and modulates immunity in mice.

AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum C4, previously isolated from kefir and characterized as a 
      potential probiotic strain, was tested for its protective and immunomodulatory 
      capacity in a murine model of yersiniosis. The inoculation of BALB/c mice with a low 
      pathogenicity serotype O9 strain of Yersinia enterocolitica results in a prolonged 
      intestinal infection with colonization of Peyer's patches. Pretreatment with C4 was 
      without effect on fecal excretion of yersiniae, but shortened the colonization of 
      Peyer's patches. This protective effect was associated with pro-inflammatory status 
      in the intestinal mucosa (TNF-α production in infected mice was increased by C4) and 
      an increase in total IgA secretion. At a systemic level, C4 did not promote a 
      pro-inflammatory response, although production of the immunoregulatory cytokine 
      IFN-γ was enhanced. These findings suggest that L. plantarum C4 can increase 
      resistance to intestinal infections through its immunomodulatory activity.

AB  - An exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing strain YW11 isolated from Tibet Kefir was 
      identified as Lactobacillus plantarum, and the strain was shown to produce 90 
      mgL(-1) of EPS when grown in a semi-defined medium. The molecular mass of the EPS 
      was 1.1 × 10(5)Da. The EPS was composed of glucose and galactose in a molar ratio of 
      2.71:1, with possible presence of N-acetylated sugar residues in the polysaccharide 
      as confirmed by NMR spectroscopy. Rheological studies showed that the EPS had higher 
      viscosity in skim milk, at lower temperature, or at acidic pH. The viscous nature of 
      the EPS was confirmed by observation with scanning electron microscopy that 
      demonstrated a highly branched and porous structure of the polysaccharide. The 
      atomic force microscopy of the EPS further revealed presence of many spherical 
      lumps, facilitating binding with water in aqueous solution. The EPS had a higher 
      degradation temperature (287.7°C), suggesting high thermal stability of the EPS.

PG  - 68-71
AB  - To study the biological value of kumyss leaven, experiments were made with 
      mono-cultures contained by kumyss leaven. The cultures Streptococcus lactis, strain 
      1-27, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, strain B-3, acetic acid bacteria and the yeast 
      culture Torulopsis kefir var kumis, strain 17 contained by kumyss leaven were 
      employed as test objects. Experiments were performed with defattened cow's milk. The 
      following parameters were measured: acidity according to Turner (T degree), dry 
      residue, total nitrogen according to Kjeldahl's micromethod, amino acid composition 
      by ion-exchange chromatography, biological value according to the amino acid score. 
      All the parameters were studied over time for 5 days. The vital activity of the 
      cultures produced different effects on the acidity, dry residue and amino acid 
      composition, therefore on the biological value of kumyss leavens. It is assumed that 
      the data obtained may be of importance for kumyss manufacture.

      introduction of sour-milk beverage with addition of beet pectin in a dietary intake. 
      The comparison product was kefir. The following developments were detected against 
      the positive dynamics of clinical symptoms: improvement of microbiocenosis 
      structure, reduction of potentially pathogenic germs, inhibition of pathogenic 
      properties of enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus. Comparison group results showed 
      lower clinical efficiency and poorer effect of dietary treatment on large gut 
      microorganisms, contents of enterotoxigenic S. aureus remained unchanged. 
      Introduction of sour-milk beverage with addition of alimentary fibre in a dietary 
      intake of patients suffering the syndrome of irritated intestines with constipations 
      was found expedient.

PG  - 115-23
AB  - A fermented milk, Kefir, contains an active substance which enhances IFN-beta 
      secretion of a human osteosarcoma line MG-63 treated with a chemical inducer, poly 
      I: poly C. The active substance in the fermented milk was identified to be 
      sphingomyelin (SpM) by a combined use of a fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry 
      (FAB-MS) and a fast atom bombardment tandem mass spectrometry (FAB-MS/MS). SpM from 
      fermented milk (F-SpM) was a mixture of four molecular species of SpMs having C21-, 
      C22-, C23- and C24-fatty acids. F-SpM enhanced the IFN secretion 14 times, SpMs from 
      other sources also enhanced moderately (2-3 times). Sphingosine and 
      lysosphingomyelin also enhanced the activity but ceramide and cerebroside did not.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the functional properties of lactic acid 
      bacteria (LAB) isolated from Tibetan kefir grains. Three Lactobacillus isolates 
      identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus LA15, Lactobacillus plantarum B23 and 
      Lactobacillus kefiri D17 that showed resistance to acid and bile salts were selected 
      for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. The 3 selected strains 
      expressed high in vitro adherence to Caco-2 cells. They were sensitive to 
      gentamicin, erythromycin and chloramphenicol and resistant to vancomycin with MIC 
      values of 26 µg/ml. All 3 strains showed potential bile salt hydrolase (BSH) 
      activity, cholesterol assimilation and cholesterol co-precipitation ability. 
      Additionally, the potential effect of these strains on plasma cholesterol levels was 
      evaluated in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Rats in 4 treatment groups were fed the 
      following experimental diets for 4 weeks: a high-cholesterol diet, a 
      high-cholesterol diet plus LA15, a high-cholesterol diet plus B23 or a 
      high-cholesterol diet plus D17. The total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the serum were significantly (P<0.05) decreased in 
      the LAB-treated rats compared with rats fed a high-cholesterol diet without LAB 
      supplementation. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in groups B23 and 
      D17 were significantly (P<0.05) higher than those in the control and LA15 groups. 
      Additionally, both fecal cholesterol and bile acid levels were significantly 
      (P<0.05) increased after LAB administration. Fecal lactobacilli counts were 
      significantly (P<0.05) higher in the LAB treatment groups than in the control 
      groups. Furthermore, the 3 strains were detected in the rat small intestine, colon 
      and feces during the feeding trial. The bacteria levels remained high even after the 
      LAB administration had been stopped for 2 weeks. These results suggest that these 
      strains may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing 
      novel fermented foods.

TI  - [Changes in intragastric proteolytic activity in patients with obesity and 
      possibilities of its dietetic correction].
PG  - 47-51
AB  - Patients suffering from alimentary obesity were examined for intragastric 
      proteolysis (IP) before and after meal. The buffer action of the food was estimated 
      in vitro according to changes in pH of gastric juice after it gets connected with 
      the products. Food intake exerting an appreciable buffer action promotes effective 
      correction of the high pH in obese patients. According to the data obtained, the 
      buffer properties of the products are determined by the magnitude of protein 
      contained by them and by the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of the given nutrient. 
      Fish, beef, chickens, cheese, cottage cheese and eggs possess the highest buffer 
      properties whereas tea, stewed fruit, fruit, juices and boiled sausage the least 
      ones. Vegetables, milk, kefir and bread occupy an intermediate position. There is a 
      direct correlation between the level of IP on an empty stomach and the degree of its 
      lowering after meal, attesting to the homeostatic nature of the process of protein 
      digestion in the stomach. The presence of that correlation is maintained owing to 
      variation of hydrochloric acid output under postprandial conditions.

TI  - Efficacy of Probiotics in Patients of Cardiovascular Disease Risk: a Systematic 
      Review and Meta-analysis.
PG  - 74
LID - 10.1007/s11906-020-01080-y [doi]
AB  - This meta-analysis examined the effect of probiotics on outcomes associated with 
      cardiovascular disease risk factors (high blood pressure, overweight BMI, high 
      cholesterol and triglycerides, elevated HbA1c and serum glucose). All randomised 
      controlled trials publish on PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Grey Literature and the 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from 1990 to 2020 were 
      systematically searched. The PEDro scale was used to assess the quality of studies. 
      A total of 34 studies with 2177 adults were selected for inclusion in the analysis. 
      The mean difference and effect size with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were 
      analysed for the pooled results. Statistically significant pooled effects of 
      probiotics were found in the reduction of systolic and diastolic blood pressure, 
      total cholesterol, LDL-C, serum glucose, HbA1C and BMI; and elevation of HDL-C. No 
      significant changes were observed in the outcome of triglycerides. Subgroup analysis 
      revealed statistically significant effects of probiotics on the treatment of risk 
      factors, with results favouring longer duration of treatment (> 1.5 months), use of 
      alternate formulations (kefir and powder), higher dosage of probiotics 
      (> 1.0 × 10(9) CFU), lower rate of study attrition (< 15%), double blinding of the 
      study, diabetic patients and female populations. In summary, our meta-analysis 
      showed a highly significant reduction in SBP, DBP associated with type 2 diabetes 
      and in patients with diabetes mellitus, milk intake and more than 1.5 months 
      duration intake. The effect on the reduction of total cholesterol LDL-C was 
      associated with diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, yoghurt intake and 
      less than 1.5 months probiotic intake. The effect on the reduction of glucose and 
      HbA1c was associated with diabetes, small dosage of probiotics, milk type and less 
      than 1.5 months duration intake. Additionally, probiotic supplement had a beneficial 
      effect in reducing BMI associated with obesity, higher dosage intake of probiotics 
      and more than 1.5 months duration of intake.

TI  - Effect of fermentation on lactose, glucose, and galactose content in milk and 
      suitability of fermented milk products for lactose intolerant individuals.
PG  - 346-52
AB  - The lactose, glucose, and galactose content in various fermented milk products was 
      studied by enzymatic methods. Lactose was decreased in all fermented products. After 
      11 days storage of yogurt the lactose content decreased to about 2.3 g/100 compared 
      to 4.8 g/100 g in nonfermented milk. During the same period, galactose content 
      increased from traces in milk to 1.3 g/100 g in yogurt. Results were similar with 
      acidophilus and bifidus milk. Buttermilk, kefir, and ropy milk showed 26, 30, and 
      20% decreases in lactose content. Eight lactose intolerant individuals showed 
      symptoms of abdominal distress and diarrhea following consumption of 500 ml of low 
      fat milk whereas ingestion of the same quantity of yogurt or acidophilus milk did 
      not result in any symptoms. Fermented milk products should be considered in 
      formulating diets for lactose-intolerant subjects.

TI  - Probiotics and athletic performance: a systematic review.
PG  - 269-73
AB  - Probiotic bacteria are defined as live food ingredients that are beneficial to the 
      health of the host. Probiotics occur naturally in fermented food products such as 
      yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, cabbage kimchee, and soybean-based miso and natto. 
      Numerous health benefits have been attributed to probiotics, including effects on 
      gastrointestinal tract function and diseases, immune function, hyperlipidemia, 
      hypertension, and allergic conditions. A systematic review of the medical literature 
      failed to identify any studies that directly investigated the potential ergogenic 
      effects of probiotics on athletic performance. Two published articles suggest that 
      probiotics may enhance the immune responses of fatigued athletes. In summary, 
      although scientific evidence for an ergogenic effect of probiotics is lacking, 
      probiotics may provide athletes with secondary health benefits that could positively 
      affect athletic performance through enhanced recovery from fatigue, improved immune 
      function, and maintenance of healthy gastrointestinal tract function.

TI  - Lactose: the milk sugar from a biotechnological perspective.
PG  - 553-7
AB  - Lactose is a very important sugar because of its abundance in the milk of humans and 
      domestic animals. Lactose is a valuable asset as a basic nutrient and the main 
      substrate in fermentative processes that led to the production of fermented milk 
      products, such as yogurt and kefir. In some instances, lactose also can be a problem 
      as the causative agent of some diseases, such as lactose intolerance and 
      galactosemia, or for being a by-product generated in huge amounts by the cheese 
      industry. The study of the biochemical reactions leading to the synthesis and 
      assimilation of lactose has provided valuable models for the understanding of 
      biosynthetic and catabolic processes. Lactose-hydrolyzing enzymes are structurally 
      and phylogenetically related to different types of beta-galactosidases and bacterial 
      cellobiases involved in the enzymatic degradation of cellulose. Biotransformation of 
      lactose, by either enzymatic or fermentative procedures, is important for different 
      types of industrial applications in dairy and pharmaceutical industries.

TI  - [Use of Robolact and Linolac dry milk mixtures in the overall therapy of infants 
      with acute intestinal infections].
PG  - 45-7
AB  - The clinical efficacy of the dry milk mixtures "Robolact" and "Linolac" manufactured 
      in Hungary was studied comprehensively in young children with acute intestinal 
      infections. It was shown that "Robolact" has a good palatability and produces a 
      satiation sensation. The children suffering from coli-infection, staphylococcal 
      enterocolitis and mixed intestinal infection received different types of feeding. In 
      children on "Robolact" feeding, the stool returned to normal over a shorter period 
      of time which was equal to 10 (+/-2) days versus 16 (+/-3) days in children on 
      natural feeding, and 12 (+/-5) days on feeding with kefir and its mixtures. The 
      mixture "Linolac" given during the amelioration of acute clinical symptoms of the 
      intestinal infection was tolerated more poorly that was manifested in regurgitations 
      in part of children and in food refusals in 15% of the cases. Examination of the 
      microflora revealed dysbacteriosis in all the patients with intestinal infections 
      regardless the type of feeding. Substantial differences in the microflora 
      composition concerned the anaerobic flora in both experimental and control groups. 
      The children on natural feeding showed the decreased bifidoflora half as frequently 
      as those on formula feeding.

TI  - Determination of antibiotic resistance of lactic acid bacteria isolated from 
      traditional Turkish fermented dairy products.
PG  - 53-56
AB  - In this study, the antibiotic resistance (AR) of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated 
      from traditional Turkish fermented dairy products was investigated. Yogurt, white 
      cheese, tulum cheese, cokelek, camız cream and kefir as dairy products were 
      collected from various supermarkets. Lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus 
      spp., Streptococcus spp., Bifidobacterium spp., and Enterecoccus spp. were isolated 
      from these dairy products. Lactobacillus spp. were resistant to vancomycin (58%), 
      erythromycin (10.8%), tetracycline (4.3%), gentamicin (28%), and ciprofloxacin 
      (26%). Streptococcus spp. were resistant to vancomycin (40%), erythromycin (10%), 
      chloramphenicol (10%), gentamicin (20%), and ciprofloxacin (30%). Bifidobacterium 
      spp. were resistant to vancomycin (60%), E 15 (6.6%), gentamicin (20%), and 
      ciprofloxacin (33%). Enterococcus spp. were resistant to vancomycin (100%), 
      erythromycin (100%), rifampin (100%), and ciprofloxacin (100%). As a result, LAB 
      islated from dairy products in this study showed mostly resistance to vancomycin.

TI  - The history of probiotics: the untold story.
PG  - 159-65
LID - 10.3920/BM2014.0103 [doi]
AB  - Probiotic, a word derived from Latin, means 'for life'. A long time before the 
      awareness of probiotic microorganisms, fermented products, such as beer, bread, 
      wine, kefir, kumis and cheese had been very frequently used for nutritional and 
      therapeutic purposes. It is widely believed that fermented products were probably 
      found, or better to say, discovered spontaneously. The legend tells that yoghurt is 
      most likely resulted from a fermentation process within the animal skin bags used 
      for transportation of water and milk in regions with low humidity and high 
      temperatures (Middle Asia and Middle East). The history of probiotics goes paralel 
      with the evolution of human race and, thanks to the sophisticated techniques at the 
      moment, can be traced back to the ancient times, nearly 10,000 years ago. The aims 
      of this review are to highlight the important events for probiotic history, to 
      correct the widely available anonymous misinformation in the literature and to 
      remind to the readers important characters in its history.

TI  - Production of 4-keto-D-arabonate by oxidative fermentation with newly isolated 
      Gluconacetobacter liquefaciens.
PG  - 2555-8
AB  - Production of 4-keto-D-arabonate (4KAB) was confirmed in a culture medium of 
      Gluconacetobacter liquefaciens strains, newly isolated from water kefir in 
      Argentina. The strains rapidly oxidized D-glucose, D-gluconate (GA), and 
      2-keto-D-gluconate (2KGA), and accumulated 2,5-diketo-D-gluconate (25DKA) 
      exclusively before reaching the stationary phase. 25DKA was in turn converted to 
      4KAB, and 4KAB remained stable in the culture medium. The occurrence of 4KAB was 
      assumed by Ameyama and Kondo about 50 years ago in their study on the carbohydrate 
      metabolism of acetic acid bacteria (Bull. Agr. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 22, 271-272, 380-386 
      (1958)). This is the first report confirming microbial production of 4KAB.

      antibacterial therapy].
PG  - 23-5
AB  - Acipole (Lactobacillus acidophilus + Kefir greins) was used to manage antibiotic 
      dysbacteriosis as an adverse reaction of antibacterial therapy. 120 patients treated 
      with antibacterial drugs for acute pneumonia and exacerbations of chronic bronchitis 
      were observed. 54 of them were treated under the routine regimen with antibiotics 
      and 66 were additionally treated with the eubiotic acipole: 1 tablet (5 doses) 3 
      times a day 30 minutes before meal. Routine bacteriological examination of the feces 
      was applied to all the patients. High frequency of bacteriologically revealed 
      dysbacteriosis was stated. The therapy under the antibiotic + acipole regimen 
      lowered the frequency of dysbacteriosis events and their severity. The fact that the 
      use of acipole simultaneously with the routine antibacterial therapy prevented the 
      development of dysbacteriosis clinical signs is of practical importance.

TI  - An introduction to the traditional fermented foods and beverages of Turkey.
PG  - 248-60
LID - 10.1080/10408390903569640 [doi]
AB  - Fermented foods and beverages, whether of plant or animal origin, play an important 
      role in the diet of people in many parts of the world. Fermented foods not only 
      provide important sources of nutrients but have also great potential in maintaining 
      health and preventing diseases. Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts are the major group 
      of microorganisms associated with traditional fermented foods. Many different types 
      of traditional fermented foods and beverages are produced at household level in 
      Anatolia. These include fermented milks (yoghurt, torba yoghurt, kurut, ayran, 
      kefir, koumiss), cereal-based fermented food (tarhana), and non-alcoholic beverage 
      (boza), fermented fruits, and vegetables (turşu, şalgam, hardaliye), and fermented 
      meat (sucuk). However, there are some differences in the preparation of traditional 
      foods and beverages from region to region. The focus of this article is to describe 
      the traditional fermented foods and beverages of Turkey.

AB  - Four strains of bifidobacteria (B. bifidum 93, B. infantis ATCC 17930, B. longum 
      ATCC 15707, and B. longum JR) cultivated in MRS broth modified by the addition of 
      cysteine-hydrochloride (0.05%) were serially subcultured in unsupplemented cow milk 
      alone or in combination with Kluyveromyces marxianus var. marxianus 269 under 
      aerobic conditions. In monoculture, bifidobacteria did not multiply after the second 
      subculture. In contrast, in coculture with yeast bifidobacteria reached counts about 
      8 log CFU/g even during 15 subcultures. In addition, K. marxianus var. marxianus 269 
      significantly prolonged the survival of bifidobacteria in milk at 4 degrees C. The 
      most susceptible strains (B. longum JR and B. infantis ATCC 17,930) completely lost 
      their viability within 5 and 12 d of storage, respectively, while in coculture with 
      yeasts all bifidobacteria cultures tested survived for at least 40 d. The results 
      could be useful in producing kefir-like fermented milks containing bifidobacteria.

      grains.
PG  - 138-46
AB  - The effects of pH, temperature and initial yeast:bacteria ratio on Lactobacillus 
      hilgardii and Saccharomyces florentinus cultivated either in pure or mixed culture 
      were studied. Quadratic polynomial as a function of factors was proposed to express 
      the lactic acid production at different sampling times, and the percentage increase 
      in lactic acid production by Lact. hilgardii in mixed culture compared with pure 
      culture. Temperature was the factor which had the main influence on lactic acid 
      production in mixed culture, whereas stimulation of bacteria depended greatly on pH 
      value. In the range 0.1-20%, the initial yeast-bacteria ratio had no effect on these 
      responses, but presence of the yeast was absolutely necessary to obtain high 
      production of lactic acid. Optimum culture conditions were determined to maximize 
      these characteristics.

PG  - 382-387
LID - 10.5114/reum.2018.80716 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The primary goal of the study was to assess calcium intake among women 
      over the age of 55. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study participants were randomly 
      selected from the female population of Zabrze, a town in the Upper Silesia Region in 
      Poland, making use of the framework of the Silesia Osteoactive Study Project. The 
      Semi-Quantitative Food Frequency Questionnaire (sFFQ) was used for nutritional 
      assessment. A total of 388 women at the median age of 65.2 years responded to 
      written and mailed invitations and decided to participate in the study. RESULTS: The 
      mean calcium intake in the group of enrolled post-menopausal women was 886.9 ±615.1 
      mg/day. Only 32.9% of the participants met the daily calcium intake criterion of > 
      1000 g/day (the Estimated Average Requirement of 1000 mg according to the Nutrition 
      Standards from 2017 for women in the age group of 51-65 years). Calcium 
      supplementation, identified among women over the age of 55 years in Zabrze, was not 
      sufficient and significantly differed from indicated nutrition standards. Fermented 
      dairy products were the main source of calcium for the studied women. The quantity 
      of calcium provided from yoghurts, kefirs and buttermilk was 338.3 mg/day. The level 
      of consumption of fortified plant products, e.g., soy milk, was found to be very 
      low. Some of the study participants (approximately 32%) reported the intake of 
      calcium supplements or OTC medicinal products with calcium. CONCLUSIONS: Summing up, 
      the studied women reported low calcium intake levels, which calls for appropriate 
      adjustments, including either dietary modifications or proper supplementation 
      programmes with calcium containing agents.

TI  - Characterization of edible emulsified films with low affinity to water based on 
      kefiran and oleic acid.

AB  - New edible composite films based on kefiran and oleic acid (OA) at the ratio of 15, 
      25, and 35% (w/w) were prepared using emulsification with the aim of improving their 
      water vapour barrier and mechanical properties. Film-forming solutions were 
      characterized in terms of rheological properties and particle-size distribution. The 
      impact of the incorporation of OA into the film matrix was studied by investigating 
      the physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of the films. The water vapour 
      permeability (WVP) of the emulsified films was reduced by approximately 33% by 
      adding OA. The mechanical properties of kefiran films were also affected by adding 
      OA: tensile strength was diminished, and elongation increased considerably. 
      Differential scanning calorimetry showed that the glass transition temperature 
      (T(g)) of the kefiran film was -16°C and was not considerably affected by adding OA. 
      Therefore, OA could be incorporated into these films for some food-technology 
      applications that need a low affinity toward water.

AB  - Biotechnological parameters of bioyogurt and biokefir production have been studied. 
      The impact of the temperature on biological activity of lactic acid bacteria strains 
      have been studied in the consortia of direct vat set (DVS). The phase of milk 
      fermentation and increase of acid production comes within 6 hours at the temperature 
      of 40 degrees C and pH in the limits of 4.7-5.1 for thermophilic strains and 30 
      degrees C and pH 5.4-5.7 for mezophilic strains. The concentration of alive cells 
      counts 5 x 10(10) CFU per 1 ml of the product. The probiotic properties of bioyogurt 
      and biokefir have been proved by clinical trials. Positive effect on the health of 
      elder people has been shown. Bioproducts have been related by clinicists to the 
      group of functional products.

      foods].
PG  - 77-80
AB  - The paper presents a comparative evaluation of antioxidant capacity and energy 
      values of different foods groups in order to identify the most efficient 
      combinations for correction of metabolic disorders associated with an imbalance in 
      antioxidant system. In study integral method for determining of antioxidant and 
      energy indicators (patent No 2,455,703) has been used. It has been revealed that the 
      highest antioxidant-energy capacity (AE) of fresh juices has a pomegranate juice (AE 
      = 3895.9 +/- 241.4 mg/L x kJ(-1)), other fresh juices inferior to him on this 
      indicator: grenade>orange>lemon=apple> pomelo > mandarin > persimmon > kiwi > pears 
      > avocado. Among dairy products the highest AE belongs to boiled fermented 
      milk--"ryazhenka" (AE = 40.9 +/- 2.7 mg/L x kJ(-1)), other dairy products can be 
      placed in line with index AE: ryazhenka ==>kefir > yogurt. Most of fresh juices were 
      significantly superior to antioxidant-energy potential of other foods. Despite the 
      fact that dairy products AE were lower than AE of some juices, they were much 
      superior to AE values of fastfood products (biscuits, potato chips, popcorn). This 
      demonstrates need to reduce the quota of fast foods in the diet to prevent the risk 
      of reduction potential of the endogenous antioxidant system.

AB  - In this study, new edible composite films were prepared by blending kefiran with 
      corn starch. Film-forming solutions of different ratios of kefiran to corn starch 
      (100/0, 70/30, 50/50, 30/70) were cast at room temperature. The effects of starch 
      addition on the resulting films' physical, mechanical and water-vapor permeability 
      (WVP) properties were investigated. Increasing starch content from 0% to 50% (v/v) 
      decreased the WVP of films; however, with further starch addition the WVP increased. 
      Also, this increase in starch content increased the tensile strength and 
      extensibility of the composite films. However, these mechanical properties decreased 
      at higher starch contents. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) curves showed 
      that addition of starch at all levels increased the glass transition temperature of 
      films. The electron scanning micrograph for the composite film was homogeneous, 
      without signs of phase separation between the components. Thus, it was observed that 
      these two film-forming components were compatible, and that an interaction existed 
      between them.

AB  - Evaluation of the degree of contamination of diary products with potentially 
      pathogenic fungal strains. Materials for the study were: yoghurt, cottage cheese, 
      homogenised cottage cheese, cream and buttermilk. Differentiation of species was 
      based on their morphological features and biochemical properties (API 20 C 
      bioMérieux). Among 300 studied diary products we have isolated 100 (33.0 +/- 2.72%) 
      strains of yeast-like fungi. Diary products were contamined with 19 species of fungi 
      from types: Candida, Geotrichum, Trichosporon, Saccharomyces and Rhodotorula. The 
      highest percentage of fungi was seen in cream (95.7 +/- 4.23%), cottage cheese (87.9 
      +/- 5.68%) and kefir (60.0 +/- 15.5%). In other studied products the frequency 
      ranged from 13.1 +/- 2.54% to 35.2 +/- 6.51%. Among the isolated fungi the following 
      species prevailed: Geotrichum candidum (18.0 +/- 3.84%), Candida lusitaniae (15.0 
      +/- 3.57%) and C. inconspicua (11.0 +/- 3.13%).

AB  - Carbon paste electrodes modified with baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (a 
      source of flavocytochrome b(2)) were investigated as amperometric biosensors for 
      lactic acid. Phenazine methosulphate was used as a mediator. The optimal operational 
      conditions of the electrodes were: an operating potential 0.0 V, solution pH 7.2, 
      concentration of phenazine methosulphate in solution 0.2 mM. A linear range in the 
      dependence of the current responses on the concentration of lactic acid was up to 1 
      mM. The suitability of the electrodes for determination of lactic acid in milk and 
      dairy products such as kefir and yoghurt was tested. The yeast cells in the paste 
      remained viable at least for 1 month.

TI  - Use of CHROMagar Candida medium for isolation of yeasts from dental samples.
PG  - 3025-7
AB  - A new differential medium, CHROMagar Candida, for the isolation of clinically 
      important yeasts was investigated to determine its usefulness in facilitating the 
      study of oral yeasts. The recovery of yeasts on the medium was not significantly 
      different from the recovery on Sabouraud dextrose agar. The identities of 450 green 
      colonies on CHROMagar Candida, presumptively identified as Candida albicans on the 
      basis of the manufacturer's instructions, were confirmed by testing for 
      beta-N-acetylgalactosaminidase. Candida tropicalis also formed distinctive colonies, 
      and other yeasts including Candida (Torulopsis) glabrata, Candida Parapsilosis, 
      Candida Magnoliae, Candida lusitaniae, Candida Famata, Candida kefir, and 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae were readily distinguished from C. albicans and C. 
      tropicalis isolates. CHROMagar Candida is a very useful medium, and its use will 
      facilitate the study of yeasts associated with dental diseases.

      30 foods on motor and evacuatory function of the gastric stump and efferent 
      intestinal loop. 213 patients were subjected to gastric resection after 
      Hofmeister-Finsterer and 40 patients to antrum resection and truncal vagotomy. 
      Proceeding from the action on motor function of the gastric stump and efferent 
      intestinal loop the foods were distributed into three groups: with a stimulation, 
      inhibitory of weak effects on the function. The first group included beef and fish 
      broths, boiled meat, rye bread, cabbage, tomato, apple, cherry and black currant 
      juices, rhubarb infusion, fresh kefir, carrot and pumpkin purees. The group of foods 
      producing an inhibitory action comprised milk and milk whey, cottage cheese, sugar, 
      butter, sunflower oil, lard, rice and oat decoctions, mashed potatoes and potato 
      juice, buckwheat porridge and semolina, wheat bread, raw eggs, and honey. The action 
      of the same foods was found to be different as regards the effect on the gastric 
      stump and efferent intestinal loop, on tonic and contractile functions of the 
      organs. The dietetic management of patients undergoing gastric operations should be 
      carried out on a strictly individualized basis with allowance made for the functions 
      of the gastric stump and intestinal loop and for the action of foods on the organs.

AB  - Environmental concern about synthetic polymers and nanoparticles bring about 
      development of the green bionanocomposite. Nanocellulose (NC) as safe nanofiller was 
      prepared from beer industrial residues by acid hydrolysis in this study. ATR-FTIR 
      spectrum showed no change in chemical structure of kefiran and NC after mixing. 
      However, mechanical, visual, and WVP properties of kefiran/NC films improved with 
      NC, but thermal properties and water sensitivity of them declined, simultaneously.

TI  - Effects of an exopolysaccharide (kefiran) on lipids, blood pressure, blood glucose, 
      and constipation.
PG  - 197-200
AB  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens was reported to produce an exopolysaccharide named 
      kefiran. In the present study, we developed a new medium, rice hydrolyzate (RH) 
      medium, for the culture of L. kefiranofaciens. Structural analyses revealed that the 
      exopolysaccharide produced by L. kefiranofaciens from RH medium was composed of a 
      hexasaccharide repeating unit, and essentially identical to the kefiran reported in 
      previous studies. A study on the effects of kefiran in animals demonstrated that 
      kefiran significantly suppressed increase of blood pressure and reduced the serum 
      cholesterol levels in SHRSP/Hos rats when subjects consumed excessive dietary 
      cholesterol. Kefiran supplementation demonstrated the ability to significantly lower 
      blood glucose in KKAy mice. In addition, the administration of kefiran in 
      constipated SD rats caused an obvious improvement in the levels of fecal moisture 
      and wet weights of feces. These results suggest that kefiran could be used as a 
      functional food to prevent some commonly occurring diseases.

TI  - Exopolysaccharides From Lactobacillus paracasei Isolated From Kefir as Potential 
      Bioactive Compounds for Microbiota Modulation.
PG  - 583254

LID - 583254
AB  - Microbiota coexists in true symbiosis with the host playing pivotal roles as a key 
      element for well-being and health. Exopolysaccharides from lactic acid bacteria are 
      an alternative as novel potential prebiotics that increase microbiota diversity. 
      Considering this, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the capacity of the 
      EPS produced by two L. paracasei strains isolated from kefir grains, to be 
      metabolized in vitro by fecal microbiota producing short chain fatty acids. For this 
      purpose, fecal samples from healthy children were inoculated in a basal medium with 
      EPS and incubated in anaerobiosis at 37°C for 24, 48, and 72 h. DGGE profiles and 
      the production of SCFA after fermentation were analyzed. Additionally, three 
      selected samples were sequenced by mass sequencing analysis using Ion Torrent PGM. 
      EPS produced by L. paracasei CIDCA 8339 (EPS(8339)) and CIDCA 83124 (EPS(83124)) are 
      metabolized by fecal microbiota producing a significant increase in SCFA. EPS(8339) 
      fermentation led to an increment of propionate and butyrate, while fermentation of 
      EPS(83124) increased butyrate levels. Both EPS led to a profile of SCFA different 
      from the ones obtained with inulin or glucose fermentation. DGGE profiles of 72 h 
      fermentation demonstrated that both EPS showed a different band profile when 
      compared to the controls; EPS profiles grouped in a cluster that have only 65% 
      similarity with glucose or inulin profiles. Mass sequencing analysis demonstrated 
      that the fermentation of EPS(8339) leads to an increase in the proportion of the 
      genera Victivallis, Acidaminococcus and Comamonas and a significant drop in the 
      proportion of enterobacteria. In the same direction, the fermentation of EPS(83124) 
      also resulted in a marked reduction of Enterobacteriaceae with a significant 
      increase in the genus Comamonas. It was observed that the changes in fecal 
      microbiota and SCFA profile exerted by both polymers are different probably due to 
      differences in their structural characteristics. It can be concluded that EPS 
      synthesized by both L. paracasei strains, could be potentially used as bioactive 
      compound that modify the microbiota increasing the production of propionic and 
      butyric acid, two metabolites highly associated with beneficial effects both at the 
      gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal level.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus kefiri 
      (PFT), a novel kefir product, on apoptosis of gastric cancer cells (AGS), breast 
      cancer cells (4T1), and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Cells were 
      cultured with PFT and apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry using 7-AAD dye and 
      cytospin preparation. Mitochondrial dysfunction and expression of Bcl2 were 
      monitored by flow cytometry. Results showed that PFT induced apoptosis in AGS 
      gastric cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Apoptosis was detected at a 
      concentration of 0.3 mg/ml (20.8%), increased to 25.8% at 0.6 mg/ml, 37% at 1.2 
      mg/ml, 53.1% at 2.5 mg/ml, and peaked at 66.3% at 5.0 mg/ml. Apoptosis is associated 
      with the decreased polarization of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and 
      decreased Bcl2 expression. PFT-treated AGS cells manifested membrane blebbing, 
      nuclear condensation, and fragmentation as identified in cytospin cytocentrifuge 
      Giemsa stained preparations. On the other hand, flow cytometry analysis showed that 
      PFT did not induce apoptosis in 4T1 breast cancer cells nor in PBMCs. These results 
      suggest that PFT is safe for white blood cells and selectively induces apoptotic 
      effects in gastric cancer cells. Hence, it may have potential as a therapeutic agent 
      for the treatment of gastric cancers.

TI  - Yeasts from Water Buffalo Mozzarella, a traditional cheese of the Mediterranean 
      area.
PG  - 45-51
AB  - Countries of the Mediterranean area are characterized by production of artisanal 
      cheeses, obtained from goat, sheep, cow and buffalo raw milk. The numbers and 
      species of yeasts in the different cheeses are variable, but some species are more 
      frequently detected than others. Kluyveromyces marxianus, K. lactis with their 
      anamorph, Candida kefir, Debaryomyces hansenii and C. famata, C. colliculosa and C. 
      catenulata are dominant species in several cheeses. However, Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae is often detected in pasta filata cheeses, such as Water Buffalo 
      Mozzarella (WBM) or Cacio Cavallo Podolico. Recently, a comprehensive study of 
      yeasts isolated from Mozzarella cheese produced in Basilicata (Southern Italy) has 
      been carried out. The study has focused on lactose and/or galactose fermenting 
      species (Kluyveromyces and Saccharomyces) to evaluate their role on the functional 
      and sensory properties of the product. End products in milk were evaluated and the 
      biodiversity in terms of production of sulphur dioxide, higher alcohols, ethyl 
      acetate, and acetaldehyde was studied. In particular, S. cerevisiae strains from 
      Water Buffalo Mozzarella cheese, compared to strains isolated from different 
      habitats, such as wine, exhibited considerable difference in the production of some 
      volatile compounds. The diversity observed could be related to the particular 
      microhabitat of S. cerevisiae occurring in whey cheese of water buffalo milk.

      detail the glycosylation of the S-layer protein of Lactobacillus kefiri CIDCA 83111. 
      A reductive β-elimination treatment followed by anion exchange high performance 
      liquid chromatography analysis was useful to characterize the O-glycosidic 
      structures. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis confirmed the presence of 
      oligosaccharides bearing from 5 to 8 glucose units carrying galacturonic acid. 
      Further nanoHPLC-ESI analysis of the glycopeptides showed two O-glycosylated 
      peptides: the peptide sequence SSASSASSA already identified as a signature 
      glycosylation motif in L. buchneri, substituted on average with eight glucose 
      residues and decorated with galacturonic acid and another O-glycosylated site on 
      peptide 471-476, with a Glc(5-8)GalA(2) structure. As ten characteristic sequons 
      (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) are present in the S-layer amino acid sequence, we performed a 
      PNGase F digestion to release N-linked oligosaccharides. Anion exchange 
      chromatography analysis showed mainly short N-linked chains. NanoHPLC-ESI in the 
      positive and negative ion modes were useful to determine two different peptides 
      substituted with short N-glycan structures. To our knowledge, this is the first 
      description of the structure of N-glycans in S-layer glycoproteins from 
      Lactobacillus species. SIGNIFICANCE: A detailed characterization of protein 
      glycosylation is essential to establish the basis for understanding and 
      investigating its biological role. It is known that S-layer proteins from 
      kefir-isolated L. kefiri strains are involved in the interaction of bacterial cells 
      with yeasts present in kefir grains and are also capable to antagonize the adverse 
      effects of different enteric pathogens. Therefore, characterization of type and site 
      of glycosidic chains in this protein may help to understand these important 
      properties. Furthermore, this is the first description of N-glycosidic chains in 
      S-layer glycoprotein from Lactobacillus spp.

PG  - 273-9
AB  - The bacterial diversity in pulque, a traditional Mexican alcoholic fermented 
      beverage, was studied in 16S rDNA clone libraries from three pulque samples. 
      Sequenced clones identified as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus strain 
      ASF360, L. kefir, L. acetotolerans, L. hilgardii, L. plantarum, Leuconostoc 
      pseudomesenteroides, Microbacterium arborescens, Flavobacterium johnsoniae, 
      Acetobacter pomorium, Gluconobacter oxydans, and Hafnia alvei, were detected for the 
      first time in pulque. Identity of 16S rDNA sequenced clones showed that bacterial 
      diversity present among pulque samples is dominated by Lactobacillus species 
      (80.97%). Seventy-eight clones exhibited less than 95% of relatedness to NCBI 
      database sequences, which may indicate the presence of new species in pulque 
      samples.

      assay.
PG  - 261-70
AB  - A high percentage of human tumors is reported to be related to dietary habits. One 
      way to improve the nutritional impact is to increase the intake of protective 
      factors, such as inhibitors of DNA damage and other types of anticarcinogens. 
      Specific strains of lactic acid bacteria used to ferment milk are promising 
      candidates that may be antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic. We have studied the 
      antimutagenicity of 10 isolated strains of beneficial lactic acid bacteria. Four 
      types of fermented milk products were also studied for their protective properties. 
      The effect of these bacteria on the yield of revertants induced by nitrosated beef 
      extract was investigated in the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay. Eight of 
      10 isolated Lactobacillus strains reduced the yield of his+ revertants almost back 
      to the levels of the untreated controls. Different fermented fresh yogurts 
      containing viable bacteria (probably Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and 
      Streptococcus thermophilus or Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria) showed 
      protective effects as well. The degree of suppressing revertants was independent of 
      the yogurt's fat content. In contrast, yogurt products that had been heat treated 
      were not inhibitory. The other fresh fermented milk products (e.g., buttermilk, 
      kefir, and "Dickmilch") were not antimutagenic in this study. The results imply that 
      some bacteria used in milk processing have an antimutagenic potential and that this 
      property is specific for the bacterial strain.

AB  - Rice kefiran is superior in functionality, has high concentration of mucilaginous 
      polysaccharide, and low lipid content, compared to conventional kefiran. However, 
      reports on its physiological functionality, especially studies on life expectancy 
      and aging, in model organisms are rare. In this study, nematodes were used as model 
      organisms that were fed rice kefiran, along with Escherichia coli OP50, as a result 
      of which, the lifespan of nematodes was extended and age-related retardation of 
      mobility was suppressed. It also increased the heat stress resistance in nematodes. 
      Experiments using daf-16 deletion mutant revealed that rice kefiran functions via 
      DAF-16. Thus, this study revealed the longevity, anti-aging and heat stress 
      tolerance effects of rice kefiran in nematodes.

TI  - Fed-batch coculture of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens with Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      for effective production of kefiran.
PG  - 557-62
AB  - In a batch coculture of kefiran-producing lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus 
      kefiranofaciens and lactate-assimilating yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lactate 
      accumulation in the medium was observed, which inhibited kefiran production. To 
      enhance kefiran productivity by preventing lactate accumulation, we conducted 
      lactose-feeding batch operation with feedforward/feedback control during the 
      coculture, so that the lactate production rate of L. kefiranofaciens was balanced 
      with the lactate consumption rate of S. cerevisiae. The lactate concentration was 
      maintained at less than 6 g l(-1) throughout the fed-batch coculture using a 5 l jar 
      fermentor, although the concentration reached 33 g l(-1) in the batch coculture. 
      Kefiran production was increased to 6.3 g in 102 h in the fed-batch coculture, 
      whereas 4.5 g kefiran was produced in 97 h in the batch coculture. The kefiran yield 
      on lactose basis was increased up to 0.033 g g(-1) in the fed-batch coculture, 
      whereas that in the batch coculture was 0.027 g g(-1).

AB  - Kefiran from kefir grains, an exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by lactic acid 
      bacteria (LAB), has received an increasing interest because of its safe status. This 
      natural biopolymer is a water-soluble glucogalactan with probed health-promoting 
      properties. However, its biological performance has yet to be completely recognized 
      and properly exploited. This research was carried out to evaluate the in vitro 
      antioxidant and the in vitro anti-inflammatory properties of Kefiran biopolymer. 
      Regarding antioxidant activity, the results demonstrated that the Kefiran extract 
      possessed the strongest reducing power and superoxide radical scavenging, over 
      hyaluronic acid (HA, gold standard viscosupplementation treatment). This 
      exopolysaccharide showed a distinct antioxidant performance in the majority of in 
      vitro working mechanisms of antioxidant activity comparing to HA. Moreover, Kefiran 
      presented an interesting capacity to scavenge nitric oxide radical comparing to the 
      gold standard that did not present any potency. Finally, the cytotoxic effects of 
      Kefiran extracts on hASCs were also performed and demonstrated no cytotoxic 
      response, ability to improve cellular function of hASCs. This study demonstrated 
      that Kefiran represented a great scavenger for reactive oxygen and nitrogen species 
      and showed also that it could be an excellent candidate to promote tissue repair and 
      regeneration.

      14C-labelled lactose in whey fermentation.

AB  - The present investigation examines the effect of pH, temperature and cell 
      concentration on lactose uptake rate, in relation with kinetics of whey fermentation 
      using kefir and determines the optimum conditions of these parameters. Lactose 
      uptake rate was measured by adding (14)C-labelled lactose in whey. The results 
      reveal the role of lactose uptake rate, being the main factor that affects the rate 
      of fermentation, in contrast to the activity of the enzymes involved in lactose 
      bioconversion process. Lactose uptake rate results discussion showed that mainly 
      Ca(2+) is responsible for the reduced whey fermentation rate in comparison with 
      fermentations using synthetic media containing lactose. Likewise, the results draw 
      up perspectives on whey fermentation research to improve whey fermentation rate. 
      Those perspectives are research to remove Ca(2+) from whey, the use of nano and 
      microtubular biopolymers and promoters such as γ-alumina pellets and volcan foaming 
      rock kissiris in order to accelerate whey fermentation.

TI  - Survival rate of Salmonella and Shigella in fermented milk products with and without 
      added human gastric juice: an in vitro study.
PG  - 19-28
AB  - The survival rates of Salmonella agona, Salmonella java, Salmonella typhimurium and 
      Shigella sonnei in milk and fermented milk products were investigated with and 
      without the addition of human gastric juice during a 7 to 10 hour test period. It 
      was found that yoghurt inhibited the growth of Salmonella and Shigella very 
      effectively even when the yoghurt had been heated to 100 degrees C for 15 minutes, 
      whereas milk and the other fermented milk products showed a lower ability to inhibit 
      the growth of pathogens. Yoghurt plus human gastric juice greatly depressed the 
      growth rate of the pathogens; after 30 minutes no more colonies were formed. Even 
      kefir or ropy milk plus gastric juice showed inhibition of Salmonella typhimurium 
      after one hour. In the case of acidophilus milk plus gastric juice, the inhibition 
      of Salmonella typhimurium occurred first after 2.5 hours and the presence of viable 
      Shigella sonnei was noticed for 4 hours. The addition of physiological NaCl instead 
      of human gastric juice to the fermented milk samples before inoculation changed the 
      picture of the survival rate. Only yoghurt inhibited the growth of Salmonella java 
      after 30 minutes; Shigella sonnei survived in yoghurt for 4 hours and in the other 
      fermented milk samples for 5 hours. It can be assumed that yoghurt contains some 
      antimicrobial compounds that inhibit the growth of pathogens and that this 
      inhibiting property is enhanced by the addition of human gastric juice.

AB  - Injectable, in-situ forming kefiran gels have been developed for potential 
      applications as implantable drug delivery devices or scaffolds for tissue 
      regeneration. Concentrated solutions (4, 5 and 6%w) of kefiran, extracted from kefir 
      grains, have been assessed in term of viscosity and injectability through G26 
      syringe needles, and for their ability to undergo gelation upon mixing with 
      different alcohols. Propylene glycol (PG) has been selected as gelling agent because 
      it ensures homogenous gelation in relatively short times (from few minutes up to 
      6 h). The investigation of the rheological behavior of kefiran/PG gels varying 
      polymer concentration and temperature (25 °C and 37 °C) has provided interesting 
      hints to support a possible gelation mechanism that accounts also for the observed 
      influence of the alcohol type. Finally, the study of kefiran/PG gels has been 
      complemented with the investigation on selected formulations of the 
      swelling/degradation behavior upon immersion in isotonic buffer solution for up to 
      40 days at 37 °C; of the ability of the gels to retain and/or release two model 
      molecules; and within vitro cell viability and cytotoxicity tests, to support the 
      absence of toxic effects on cells induced by direct contact with the gels or by 
      leached components from these gels.

TI  - Species classifier choice is a key consideration when analysing low-complexity food 
      microbiome data.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of shotgun metagenomics to analyse low-complexity microbial 
      communities in foods has the potential to be of considerable fundamental and applied 
      value. However, there is currently no consensus with respect to choice of species 
      classification tool, platform, or sequencing depth. Here, we benchmarked the 
      performances of three high-throughput short-read sequencing platforms, the Illumina 
      MiSeq, NextSeq 500, and Ion Proton, for shotgun metagenomics of food microbiota. 
      Briefly, we sequenced six kefir DNA samples and a mock community DNA sample, the 
      latter constructed by evenly mixing genomic DNA from 13 food-related bacterial 
      species. A variety of bioinformatic tools were used to analyse the data generated, 
      and the effects of sequencing depth on these analyses were tested by randomly 
      subsampling reads. RESULTS: Compositional analysis results were consistent between 
      the platforms at divergent sequencing depths. However, we observed pronounced 
      differences in the predictions from species classification tools. Indeed, PERMANOVA 
      indicated that there was no significant differences between the compositional 
      results generated by the different sequencers (p = 0.693, R(2) = 0.011), but there 
      was a significant difference between the results predicted by the species 
      classifiers (p = 0.01, R(2) = 0.127). The relative abundances predicted by the 
      classifiers, apart from MetaPhlAn2, were apparently biased by reference genome 
      sizes. Additionally, we observed varying false-positive rates among the classifiers. 
      MetaPhlAn2 had the lowest false-positive rate, whereas SLIMM had the greatest 
      false-positive rate. Strain-level analysis results were also similar across 
      platforms. Each platform correctly identified the strains present in the mock 
      community, but accuracy was improved slightly with greater sequencing depth. 
      Notably, PanPhlAn detected the dominant strains in each kefir sample above 500,000 
      reads per sample. Again, the outputs from functional profiling analysis using 
      SUPER-FOCUS were generally accordant between the platforms at different sequencing 
      depths. Finally, and expectedly, metagenome assembly completeness was significantly 
      lower on the MiSeq than either on the NextSeq (p = 0.03) or the Proton (p = 0.011), 
      and it improved with increased sequencing depth. CONCLUSIONS: Our results 
      demonstrate a remarkable similarity in the results generated by the three sequencing 
      platforms at different sequencing depths, and, in fact, the choice of bioinformatics 
      methodology had a more evident impact on results than the choice of sequencer did.

AB  - Whole-genome sequencing was performed for Lactobacillus parakefiri JCM 8573(T) to 
      confirm its hitherto controversial taxonomic position. Here, we report its first 
      reliable reference genome. Genome-wide metrics, such as average nucleotide identity 
      and digital DNA-DNA hybridization, and phylogenomic analysis based on multiple genes 
      supported its taxonomic status as a distinct species in the genus Lactobacillus. The 
      availability of a reliable genome sequence will aid future investigations on the 
      industrial applications of L. parakefiri in functional foods such as kefir grains.

TI  - Comparing the Survivability of Lactobacillus Species in Various Probiotic Delivery 
      Vehicles.
PG  - 1411-1413
LID - 10.1177/0148607116672266 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotics are widely used in healthy and nonhealthy individuals to 
      maintain a favorable gut microbiome and inhibit pathogen takeover. Currently, there 
      are many varieties of probiotic delivery vehicles on the market, with no real 
      research indicating which is the most effective at allowing for colon colonization. 
      In this study, we sought to determine if probiotic preparation influences the 
      ability of Lactobacillus species, one of the most common genera of probiotic 
      bacteria, to survive gastric acidity. OBJECTIVE: To determine the survivability of 
      lactobacilli in stomach-level acidity for a variety of probiotic delivery vehicles. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: We tested the ability of 6 different probiotic 
      preparations-enterically encapsulated pills, nonencapsulated pills, lyophilized 
      powder, yogurt, yogurt drink, and kefir-to enhance survivability of lactobacilli in 
      pH 2.0-adjusted phosphate-buffered saline over time. Colony-forming units were 
      enumerated by spot plating on both nonselective (brain-heart infusion) and selective 
      (Rogosa SL) agar. RESULTS: Regardless of delivery vehicle, lactobacilli are very 
      capable of surviving gastric acidity, allowing for passage into the intestines.

TI  - Improved synthesis of chiral alcohols with Escherichia coli cells co-expressing 
      pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase, NADP+-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase and 
      NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase.
PG  - 1739-44
AB  - Recombinant pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase (PNT) from Escherichia coli has 
      been used to regenerate NAD+ and NADPH. The pnta and pntb genes encoding for the 
      alpha- and beta-subunits were cloned and co-expressed with NADP+-dependent alcohol 
      dehydrogenase (ADH) from Lactobacillus kefir and NAD+-dependent formate 
      dehydrogenase (FDH) from Candida boidinii. Using this whole-cell biocatalyst, 
      efficient conversion of prochiral ketones to chiral alcohols was achieved: 66% 
      acetophenone was reduced to (R)-phenylethanol over 12 h, whereas only 19% 
      (R)-phenylethanol was formed under the same conditions with cells containing ADH and 
      FDH genes but without PNT genes. Cells that were permeabilized with toluene showed 
      ketone reduction only if both cofactors were present.

TI  - Nisin production by a mixed-culture system consisting of Lactococcus lactis and 
      Kluyveromyces marxianus.
PG  - 3134-41
AB  - To control the pH during antimicrobial peptide (nisin) production by a lactic acid 
      bacterium, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (ATCC11454), a novel method involving 
      neither addition of alkali nor a separation system such as a ceramic membrane filter 
      and electrodialyzer was developed. A mixed culture of L. lactis and Kluyveromyces 
      marxianus, which was isolated from kefir grains, was utilized in the developed 
      system. The interaction between lactate production by L. lactis and its assimilation 
      by K. marxianus was used to control the pH. To utilize the interaction of these 
      microorganisms to maintain high-level production of nisin, the kinetics of growth 
      of, and production of lactate, acetate, and nisin by, L. lactis were investigated. 
      The kinetics of growth of and lactic acid consumption by K. marxianus were also 
      investigated. Because the pH of the medium could be controlled by the lactate 
      consumption of K. marxianus and the specific lactate consumption rate of K. 
      marxianus could be controlled by changing the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, a 
      cascade pH controller coupled with DO control was developed. As a result, the pH was 
      kept constant because the lactate level was kept low and nisin accumulated in the 
      medium to a high level compared with that attained using other pH control 
      strategies, such as with processes lacking pH control and those in which pH is 
      controlled by addition of alkali.

AB  - Although acetic acid bacteria (AAB) are commonly found in spontaneous or backslopped 
      fermented foods and beverages, rather limited knowledge about their occurrence and 
      functional role in natural food fermentation ecosystems is available. Not only is 
      their cultivation, isolation, and identification difficult, their cells are often 
      present in a viable but not culturable state. Yet, they are promising starter 
      cultures either to better control known food fermentation processes or to produce 
      novel fermented foods and beverages. This review summarizes the most recent findings 
      on the occurrence and functional role of AAB in natural food fermentation processes 
      such as lambic beer, water kefir, kombucha, and cocoa.

TI  - Enhancing acid tolerance of Leuconostoc mesenteroides with glutathione.
PG  - 683-7
LID - 10.1007/s10529-011-0815-1 [doi]
AB  - Leuconostoc mesenteroides is a commercially important lactic acid bacterium 
      currently used as a starter for kimchi and kefir. However, its sensitivity to acid 
      stress limits its performance. L. mesenteroides was grown in a medium supplemented 
      with 3.2 or 6.4 mM glutathione (GSH), and cell survival rates were measured during a 
      long-term mild acid challenge (pH 4.0). As a result, GSH was imported by the cells 
      and protected against acid stress; thereafter it was consumed as a nutrient. Acid 
      stress resistance of starter cultures of this bacterium can thus be improved by 
      cultivating it in media supplemented with GSH.

TI  - Rheological and structural characterisation of film-forming solutions and 
      biodegradable edible film made from kefiran as affected by various plasticizer 
      types.
PG  - 814-21
LID - 10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2011.07.018 [doi]
AB  - The rheological properties of kefiran film-forming solutions, as well as the 
      structural characterisation of the resulting films, were investigated as a function 
      of various plasticizer types. The behaviours of the storage (G') and loss (G″) 
      moduli as a function of frequency were typical of gel-like material, with the G' 
      higher than the G″. Kefiran-based films, which may find application as edible films, 
      were prepared by a casting and solvent-evaporation method. Possible interaction 
      between the adjacent chains in the kefiran polymer and various plasticizers was 
      proven by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The crystallinity of 
      plasticized kefiran film was also analysed using X-ray diffraction (XRD); this 
      revealed an amorphous-crystalline structure. These results were explained by the 
      film's microstructure, which was analysed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and 
      scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The present study has helped determine possible 
      interactions of kefiran, plasticizer and water molecules in determining film 
      properties.

TI  - A novel convenient procedure for extractive work-up of whole-cell biotransformations 
      using de-emulsifying hydrolases.
PG  - 525-36
AB  - Extractive work-up of whole-cell biotransformations generally suffers from the 
      formation of stable gels and slimes upon addition of the organic solvent to the cell 
      suspension and the cell-free solution, respectively. This problem has been overcome 
      by enzymatic lysis of emulsifying agents present in the medium through addition of 
      hydrolases. Of these agents, proteases have exhibited the most powerful 
      de-emulsifying activity. Enzyme treatment of cell-free culture media of 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae with pronase E drastically reduced phase separation time 
      (t(p)) from 1 week to 30 min without significantly affecting product integrity. 
      Yeast cell suspensions were de-emulsified best with protease N-01, where phase 
      separation was complete after 1 h. As was exemplified with cell-free culture media 
      of Lactobacillus kefir, wherein addition of pronase E or protease N-01 reduced t(p) 
      from 1 week to 2 h each, this practical, ready-to-use method is appropriate for both 
      fungal and bacterial biocatalysts.

TI  - Yeast prion-based metabolic reprogramming induced by bacteria in fermented foods.
LID - foz061 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/femsyr/foz061 [doi]
AB  - Microbial communities of yeast and bacterial cells are often observed in the 
      manufacturing processes of fermented foods and drinks, such as sourdough bread, 
      cheese, kefir, wine and sake. Community interactions and dynamics among 
      microorganisms, as well as their significance during the manufacturing processes, 
      are central issues in modern food microbiology. Recent studies demonstrated that the 
      emergence of a yeast prion termed [GAR+] in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is induced by 
      coculturing with bacterial cells, resulting in the switching of the carbon 
      metabolism. In order to facilitate mutualistic symbiosis among microorganisms, this 
      mode of microbial interaction is induced between yeasts and lactic acid bacteria 
      species used in traditional sake making. Thus, yeast prions have attracted much 
      attention as novel platforms that govern the metabolic adaptation of cross-kingdom 
      ecosystems. Our minireview focuses on the plausible linkage between fermented-food 
      microbial communication and yeast prion-mediated metabolic reprogramming.

AB  - This paper reports on an experiment in which starch/kefiran/TiO(2) (SKT)-based 
      bio-nanocomposite films were developed and modified by photo-chemical reaction. In 
      so doing, film-forming solutions were exposed to ultraviolet A (UV-A) for different 
      times (1, 6, and 12 h). The obtained results indicated that increasing UV-A exposure 
      time brought about an increase (≈14.9%) in the tensile strength of 
      bio-nanocomposites. However, elongation at break and Young's modulus of irradiated 
      film specimen decreased (≈32%, ≈12%, respectively) by increasing UV-A exposure time, 
      and the moisture-sensitive parameters of specimen decreased using UV-A irradiation. 
      According to the results, the functional properties of irradiated bio-nanocomposite 
      are depended on the ratio of cross-linkages between polymer chains and the 
      potentially produced mono and disaccharide by UV-A.

TI  - Review - Lactic acid bacteria in traditional fermented Asian foods.
PG  - 1803-1814
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria play vital roles in various fermented foods in Asia. This paper 
      reviews many types of the world's lactic acid fermented foods and discusses the 
      beneficial effects of lactic acid fermentation of food. The lactic acid bacteria 
      associated with foods now include species of the genera Carnobacterium, 
      Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Oenococcus, Pediococcus, 
      Streptococcus, Tetragenococcus, Vagococcus and Weissella. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) 
      are involved in many fermentation processes of Asian traditional foods, 
      demonstrating their profound effects on improving food quality and food safety. 
      During the past few decades' interest has arisen in the use of the varied 
      antagonistic activities of LAB to extent the shelf-life of protein-rich products 
      such as meats and fish. This review article outlines the main types of LAB 
      fermentation as well as their typical fermented foods such as idli, kishk, 
      sauerkraut, koumiss, Suan-tsai, stinky tofu, Chinese sausage and kefir. The roles of 
      LAB and the reasons for their common presence are also discussed.

TI  - An application in cheddar cheese manufacture for a strain of Lactococcus lactis 
      producing a novel broad-spectrum bacteriocin, lacticin 3147.
PG  - 612-9
AB  - Lactococcus lactis DPC3147, a strain isolated from an Irish kefir grain, produces a 
      bacteriocin with a broad spectrum of inhibition. The bacteriocin produced is heat 
      stable, particularly at a low pH, and inhibits nisin-producing (Nip+) lactococci. On 
      the basis of the observation that the nisin structural gene (nisA) does not 
      hybridize to DPC3147 genomic DNA, the bacteriocin produced was considered novel and 
      designated lacticin 3147. The genetic determinants which encode lacticin 3147 are 
      contained on a 63-kb plasmid, which was conjugally mobilized to a commercial cheese 
      starter, L. lactis subsp. cremoris DPC4268. The resultant transconjugant, DPC4275, 
      both produces and is immune to lacticin 3147. The ability of lacticin 3147-producing 
      lactococci to perform as cheddar cheese starters was subsequently investigated in 
      cheesemaking trials. Bacteriocin-producing starters (which included the 
      transconjugant strain DPC4275) produced acid at rates similar to those of commercial 
      strains. The level of lacticin 3147 produced in cheese remained constant over 6 
      months of ripening and correlated with a significant reduction in the levels of 
      nonstarter lactic acid bacteria. Such results suggest that these starters provide a 
      means of controlling developing microflora in ripened fermented products.

AB  - The authors studied the effects of the active ingredients contained in 43 pesticides 
      and insecticides on dairy cultures and the suitability of milk contaminated in vitro 
      with selected organophosphorus insecticides. The acid-forming property of yoghurt, 
      kefir, butter and cheese cultures, the clotting property of milk and the ripening 
      process of Camembert were used as testing criteria. The herbicides 
      2-methyl-4,6-dinitrophenol (DNOC), 2,4, 5-trichlorophenol, 
      2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (MCPA), 4-(2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxy) butyric 
      acid (MPCB), 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 2,2-dichloropropionic acid 
      (dalapon), the chlorinated insecticide heptachlorepoxide and the fungicide 
      pentachlorophenol exerted inhibitory effects when applied at concentrations of more 
      than 100 p.p.m., whereas most of the organophosphorus and chlorinated insecticides 
      under investigation produced no detectable effects on the culture activity when used 
      at concentrations up to 100 mg/kg. The clotting property of milk was not impaired by 
      the pesticides and insecticides at concentrations up to 100 mg/kg; the same was true 
      of the ripening process of Camembert.

AB  - Many studies have investigated the anti-obesity effects of probiotics in animal 
      models and humans. However, few studies have focused on the mechanisms of 
      obesity-inducing probiotics. In a previous study, we demonstrated that specific 
      bacterial strains isolated from kefir, Lactobacillus kefirnofaciens M1 and 
      Lactobacillus mali APS1, possess obesity and anti-obesity effects, respectively, in 
      high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Thus, in the present study, we 
      systematically investigated whether APS1 and M1 affect energy homeostasis and lipid 
      metabolism in HFD-induced obese mice and how this might be achieved. We observed 
      that the M1/APS1 intervention influenced fat accumulation by regulating adipogenesis 
      and inflammation-related marker expression both in vitro and in a HFD induced 
      C57BL/6J mice model. We also observed putative links between key taxa and possible 
      metabolic processes of the gut microbiota. Notably, families Christensenellaceae and 
      S24_7 were negatively correlated with body weight gain through increase in the 
      essential esterized carnitine for energy expenditure. These results suggest the 
      importance of specific probiotic interventions affecting leanness and obesity of 
      subjects under a HFD, which are operated by modulating the tripartite relationship 
      among the host, microbiota, and metabolites.

TI  - A dynamic model that simulates the human upper gastrointestinal tract for the study 
      of probiotics.
PG  - 287-96
AB  - A dynamic model of the human upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract was designed to 
      better simulate conditions of ingestion and digestion, by including a food matrix as 
      part of the model design. The dynamic model consisted of two reactors maintained at 
      37 degrees C, one simulating stomach conditions and the other simulating duodenum 
      conditions. The model was tested by comparing survival of bacteria isolated from 
      humans (Bifidobacterium infantis, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, 
      and Lactobacillus acidophilus) animals (Bifidobacterium animalis, 2 strains), and 
      fermented dairy products (Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus kefir, Lactobacillus 
      kefirgranum, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) with their survival as determined by 
      conventional methods. Five strains were not able to survive (>3 log reduction) 15 
      min in a medium acidified at pH 2.0 using the conventional testing method, but 
      survival was improved significantly for some strains in the dynamic model. Two 
      strains (Bifidobacterium animalis ATCC 25527 and Lactobacillus johnsonii La-1 NCC 
      533) showed good survival with both methods. The dynamic model was shown to better 
      represent the events during upper GI tract transit than the conventional methods, by 
      incorporation of a food matrix to buffer the gastric acidity and therefore expose 
      bacteria to pH levels found in vivo before, during, and after a meal.

AB  - Fluoro-substituted and heteroaromatic compounds are valuable intermediates for a 
      variety of applications in pharma- and agrochemistry and synthetic chemistry. This 
      study investigates the chemoenzymatic preparation of chiral alcohols bearing a 
      heteroaromatic ring with an increasing degree of fluorination in α-position. 
      Starting from readily available picoline derivatives prochiral α-halogenated acyl 
      moieties were introduced with excellent selectivity and 64-95 % yield. The formed 
      carbonyl group was subsequently reduced to the corresponding alcohols using the 
      alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus kefir, yielding an enantiomeric excess of 
      95->99 % and up to 98 % yield.

TI  - Fermented-Food Metagenomics Reveals Substrate-Associated Differences in Taxonomy and 
      Health-Associated and Antibiotic Resistance Determinants.

LID - e00522-20
AB  - Fermented foods have been the focus of ever greater interest as a consequence of 
      purported health benefits. Indeed, it has been suggested that consumption of these 
      foods helps to address the negative consequences of "industrialization" of the human 
      gut microbiota in Western society. However, as the mechanisms via which the microbes 
      in fermented foods improve health are not understood, it is necessary to develop an 
      understanding of the composition and functionality of the fermented-food microbiota 
      to better harness desirable traits. Here, we considerably expand the understanding 
      of fermented-food microbiomes by employing shotgun metagenomic sequencing to provide 
      a comprehensive insight into the microbial composition, diversity, and functional 
      potential (including antimicrobial resistance and carbohydrate-degrading and 
      health-associated gene content) of a diverse range of 58 fermented foods from 
      artisanal producers from a number of countries. Food type, i.e., dairy-, sugar-, or 
      brine-type fermented foods, was the primary driver of microbial composition, with 
      dairy foods found to have the lowest microbial diversity. From the combined data 
      set, 127 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), including 10 MAGs 
      representing putatively novel species of Acetobacter, Acidisphaera, Gluconobacter, 
      Companilactobacillus, Leuconostoc, and Rouxiella, were generated. Potential health 
      promoting attributes were more common in fermented foods than nonfermented 
      equivalents, with water kefirs, sauerkrauts, and kvasses containing the greatest 
      numbers of potentially health-associated gene clusters. Ultimately, this study 
      provides the most comprehensive insight into the microbiomes of fermented foods to 
      date and yields novel information regarding their relative health-promoting 
      potential.IMPORTANCE Fermented foods are regaining popularity worldwide due in part 
      to a greater appreciation of the health benefits of these foods and the associated 
      microorganisms. Here, we use state-of-the-art approaches to explore the microbiomes 
      of 58 of these foods, identifying the factors that drive the microbial composition 
      of these foods and potential functional benefits associated with these populations. 
      Food type, i.e., dairy-, sugar-, or brine-type fermented foods, was the primary 
      driver of microbial composition, with dairy foods found to have the lowest microbial 
      diversity and, notably, potential health promoting attributes were more common in 
      fermented foods than nonfermented equivalents. The information provided here will 
      provide significant opportunities for the further optimization of fermented-food 
      production and the harnessing of their health-promoting potential.

AB  - Nowadays, an increasing attention is being given to fermented milk products 
      including yogurt, kefir, buttermilk, and acidophilus milk. Fermented milks, 
      especially the ones containing probiotics, are claimed to be useful for health of 
      host (such as intestinal- and immune-associated diseases). Their healthful effects 
      could be significantly enhanced by incorporating probiotic microorganisms; those 
      have healthful advantages for host when consumed in an appropriate viable number in 
      food products. Probiotic dairy products have stepped to the market and are being 
      commercially produced under various brand names. In addition, these products are 
      legislatively obliged to be labeled for the microorganisms contained. Therefore, 
      identification and enumeration of their microorganisms are a cause of concern. 
      Several culture-dependent methods have been introduced and used to identify the 
      microorganisms, in which the researchers have experienced multiple difficulties. 
      Thereby, molecular approaches were present as an alternative, offering advantages 
      such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and speed. This article reviews the 
      molecular approaches employed for identification and enumeration of probiotics in 
      fermented milk products.

AB  - In this study, we assessed the anti-asthmatic effects of heat-inactivated 
      Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens M1 (HI-M1) and its fermented milk using different 
      feeding procedures and at various dosage levels. The possible mechanisms whereby 
      HI-M1 has anti-allergic asthmatic effects were also evaluated. Ovalbumin 
      (OVA)-allergic asthma mice that have been orally administrated the HI-M1 samples 
      showed strong inhibition of production of T helper cell (Th) 2 cytokines, 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, and Th17 cytokines in splenocytes and bronchoalveolar 
      fluid compared to control mice. An increase in regulatory T cell population in 
      splenocytes in the allergic asthma mice after oral administration of H1-M1 was also 
      observed. In addition, all of the features of the asthmatic phenotype, including 
      specific IgE production, airway inflammation, and development of airway 
      hyperresponsiveness, were depressed in a dose-dependent manner by treatment. These 
      findings support the possibility that oral feeding of H1-M1 may be an effective way 
      of alleviating asthmatic symptoms in humans.

TI  - Kefiran protects Caco-2 cells from cytopathic effects induced by Bacillus cereus 
      infection.
PG  - 505-13
LID - 10.1007/s10482-009-9366-z [doi]
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of kefiran to antagonize cytopathic 
      effects triggered by Bacillus cereus strain B10502 on cultured human enterocytes 
      (Caco-2 cells). Cell damage was evaluated by F-actin labelling, scanning electron 
      microscopy and determination of ratios of necrotic and detached cells. To assess the 
      interaction between kefiran and bacteria or eukaryotic cells, flow cytometric 
      analysis was conducted with FITC-labelled kefiran. Kefiran significantly protected 
      infected cells from cytopathic effects induced by B. cereus such as cell necrosis, 
      F-actin disorganisation and microvilli effacement, although presence of kefiran did 
      not modify the adhesion of microorganisms to cultured human enterocytes. Results 
      could be ascribed to the ability of kefiran to interact with both bacteria and 
      eukaryotic cells thus antagonizing interactions necessary for maximal biological 
      effects. Our findings encourage further research on the use of bacterial 
      exopolysaccharides to antagonize virulence factors associated to direct 
      bacteria-cell interactions.

TI  - Variability of orotic acid concentration in cow's milk.
PG  - 79-82
AB  - The average concentration of orotic acid in the milk of 412 Black and White bred 
      cows from four Polish provinces was 0.618 +/- 0.233 mmol/l. There was no correlation 
      between milk yield and concentration of orotic acid. A higher concentration of this 
      pyrimidine in younger cows, and its increase during development of lactation was 
      noted. The yearly pattern of orotic acid in milk and urine of four low-, and four 
      high-orotate cows was examined. In spite of high average differences in milk orotate 
      (0.397 and 0.813 mmol/l) no significant differences in urinary orotate (20.96 and 
      21.90 mumol/mmol creatinine) were observed. In both groups the lowest milk orotate 
      level occurred in early lactation. The orotic acid content (mmol/l) in commercial 
      milk products was as follows: skim milk--0.783; evaporated milk--0.538; cream 12% 
      fat--0.367; buttermilk--0.449; yogurt--0.331; kefir--0.341; sour milk 2% fat--0.360; 
      dried skim milk--1.042; Bebiko I (infant formula)--0.650. Leukemia led to the 
      elevation (0.845 mmol/l), whereas mastitis to the depression (0.124 mmol/l) of milk 
      orotic acid level.

TI  - Cross-kingdom inhibition of bacterial virulence and communication by probiotic yeast 
      metabolites.
PG  - 70
LID - 10.1186/s40168-021-01027-8 [doi]
LID - 70
AB  - BACKGROUND: Probiotic milk-fermented microorganism mixtures (e.g., yogurt, kefir) 
      are perceived as contributing to human health, and possibly capable of protecting 
      against bacterial infections. Co-existence of probiotic microorganisms are likely 
      maintained via complex biomolecular mechanisms, secreted metabolites mediating 
      cell-cell communication, and other yet-unknown biochemical pathways. In particular, 
      deciphering molecular mechanisms by which probiotic microorganisms inhibit 
      proliferation of pathogenic bacteria would be highly important for understanding 
      both the potential benefits of probiotic foods as well as maintenance of healthy gut 
      microbiome. RESULTS: The microbiome of a unique milk-fermented microorganism mixture 
      was determined, revealing a predominance of the fungus Kluyveromyces marxianus. We 
      further identified a new fungus-secreted metabolite-tryptophol acetate-which 
      inhibits bacterial communication and virulence. We discovered that tryptophol 
      acetate blocks quorum sensing (QS) of several Gram-negative bacteria, particularly 
      Vibrio cholerae, a prominent gut pathogen. Notably, this is the first report of 
      tryptophol acetate production by a yeast and role of the molecule as a signaling 
      agent. Furthermore, mechanisms underscoring the anti-QS and anti-virulence 
      activities of tryptophol acetate were elucidated, specifically down- or upregulation 
      of distinct genes associated with V. cholerae QS and virulence pathways. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study illuminates a yet-unrecognized mechanism for cross-kingdom 
      inhibition of pathogenic bacteria cell-cell communication in a probiotic 
      microorganism mixture. A newly identified fungus-secreted molecule-tryptophol 
      acetate-was shown to disrupt quorum sensing pathways of the human gut pathogen V. 
      cholerae. Cross-kingdom interference in quorum sensing may play important roles in 
      enabling microorganism co-existence in multi-population environments, such as 
      probiotic foods and the gut microbiome. This discovery may account for 
      anti-virulence properties of the human microbiome and could aid elucidating health 
      benefits of probiotic products against bacterially associated diseases. Video

TI  - Evaluation of Pediococcus pentosaceus SP2 as Starter Culture on Sourdough Bread 
      Making.
LID - 10.3390/foods9010077 [doi]
LID - 77
AB  - In the present study, a novel Pediococcus pentosaceus SP2 strain, recently isolated 
      from kefir grains, was evaluated as a starter culture in sourdough bread making. The 
      novel starter was applied in fresh, freeze-dried, and freeze-dried immobilized (on 
      wheat bran) form. The type of culture (fresh, freeze-dried, immobilized cells) 
      influenced the bread characteristics. Specifically, the application of freeze-dried 
      immobilized cells led to higher total titratable acidity (TTA) values (9.81 mL NaOH 
      N/10), and the produced bread presented higher resistance to mold and rope spoilage. 
      Moreover, the produced sourdough breads were significantly better in terms of pH, 
      TTA, organic acids content, and resistance to mold and rope spoilage, compared to 
      breads made with a commercial, wild microbiota, sourdough. The organic acids content 
      was also significantly higher than the commercial sourdough sample (2.93 g/kg lactic 
      acid; 1.01 g/kg acetic acid). Determination of volatile compounds through 
      solid-phase microextraction (SPME) gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) 
      analysis and sensorial assessments indicated no significant differences between the 
      tested sourdough breads.

PG  - 1038-43
LID - 10.1016/j.revmed.2008.05.010 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Current unusual environmental sources of lead exposure mainly include 
      traditional medicines, either ayurvedic remedies or others, traditional cosmetics 
      (kohl, surma), and the use of traditional earthenware, for storage or cooking. CASE 
      REPORTS: We report two cases of lead poisoning in adults initially identified by 
      paroxysmal abdominal pain or anemia. In both cases, the environmental investigation 
      evidenced one main source of lead exposure, namely a lead-glazed earthenware jug in 
      which a drink was stored, "kefir" in the first case, and "kombucha" tea in the 
      second one. CONCLUSION: It is recommended to search for lead intoxication in 
      patients with unexplained anemia. Environmental sources of lead can be multiple. 
      Their relative importance has to be ranked during the environmental investigation 
      and among these, lead-glazed earthenware must be considered as a source of high lead 
      exposure when drinks are stored inside and thus can soak.

TI  - Effects of fermentation time and pH on quality of black carrot juice fermented by 
      kefir culture during storage.
LID - 10.1002/jsfa.11598 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effects of fermentation time (17-48 h) and pH (3.37-4.50) on 
      qualities of fermented beverages (FBs) produced from black carrot juice (BCJ) were 
      monitored during storage at 4 °C for 20 weeks. RESULTS: Fermentation and adjusting 
      the pH level provided significant increases (up to 22%) in anthocyanin content and 
      the absorbance value at λ(max) (A(max) ). Moreover, the stability of anthocyanins, 
      color density, and A(max) in FBs was somewhat higher than those in BCJ. Lactic acid 
      showed a co-pigmentation effect on cyanidin-3-galactoside-xyloside-glucoside-sinapic 
      acid and cyanidin-3-galactoside-xyloside-glucoside-ferulic acid. Sucrose was 
      degraded much faster at pH 4.50 (17 h) and 4.35 (48 h) than at lower pH levels. 
      During storage, pH 4.35 caused a balanced distribution between counts of lactic acid 
      bacteria (LAB) and yeasts, and antioxidant activity of all FBs increased. Fermented 
      beverages at 4.35 and 3.90 were found to be more palatable by panelists. CONCLUSION: 
      We recommend FB production at pH 4.35 after 48 h fermentation due to the balanced 
      distribution of probiotics, high color enhancement, and consumer preference. © 2021

AB  - Atopic dermatitis (AD) causes chronic inflammatory skin disease that results in a 
      considerable economic expense and social burden. Certain Lactobacillus strains 
      ameliorate AD, but the effects of probiotic yeast on AD have not been investigated 
      to date. In this study, we isolated Kazachstania turicensis CAU Y1706, commonly 
      known as a kefir yeast, and evaluated its mitigating effects using an 
      ovalbumin-sensitized AD mouse model. Overall, K. turicensis CAU Y1706 was generally 
      effective against AD. Oral administration of K. turicensis CAU Y1706 suppressed T 
      helper type 2 immune response factors by regulatory T cells and upregulation of T 
      helper type 1 cytokine levels. Kazachstania turicensis CAU Y1706 also reduced IgE 
      levels as well as the number of eosinophil and mast cells. Furthermore, feces from 
      K. turicensis CAU Y1706-treated mice had more butyrate-producing bacteria, such as 
      Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Ruminococcus, and Akkermansia, although the level of 
      Fecalibacterium was significantly reduced. Therefore, K. turicensis CAU Y1706 
      modulates immune responses as well as gut microbiota, thus indicating that it has 
      potential for application as a supplement for alleviation of AD.

AB  - Lactobacillus (L.) mali APS1 isolated from sugary kefir grains has been proven to 
      affect energy and glucose homeostasis. However, without proper safety assessment it 
      cannot be recommended as probiotics for human consumption. For genotoxicity, the 
      Ames test showed no mutagenic effect of L. mali APS1 in the presence or absence of 
      S9 mix metabolic activation. In-vitro mammalian chromosomal aberration test showed 
      that the number of Chinese hamster ovary cells with abnormal chromosomes was <5% 
      after L. mali APS1 treatment. Moreover, L. mali APS1 showed no risk of genotoxicity 
      potential compared to the control. L. mali APS1 administration did not cause 
      significant (p>0.05) changes in body weight, the number of reticulocytes, or in the 
      occurrence percentage of micronucleus in Imprinting Control Region (ICR) mice. Based 
      on the absence of maternal or fetal effects at any dosage level investigated, the 
      teratogenicity could be defined as greater than 1,670 mg/kg b.w./day for maternal 
      general toxicity and fetal development when L. mali APS1 was orally administered by 
      gavage to pregnant SD rats during gestation days 6 to 15.

AB  - A levan-producing strain, BD1707, was isolated from Tibetan kefir and identified as 
      Leuconostoc citreum. The effects of carbon sources on the growth of L. citreum 
      BD1707 and levan production in tomato juice were measured. The changes in pH, viable 
      cell count, sugar content, and levan yield in the cultured tomato juice supplemented 
      with 15% (wt/vol) sucrose were also assayed. L. citreum BD1707 could synthesize more 
      than 28 g/liter of levan in the tomato juice-sucrose medium when cultured at 30°C 
      for 96 h. Based on the monosaccharide composition, molecular mass distribution, 
      Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) 
      spectra, the levan synthesized by L. citreum BD1707 was composed of a linear 
      backbone consisting of consecutive β-(2→6) linked d-fructofuranosyl units, with an 
      estimated average molecular mass of 4.3 × 10(6) Da.

TI  - Application of a novel thermostable NAD(P)H oxidase from hyperthermophilic archaeon 
      for the regeneration of both NAD⁺ and NADP⁺.
PG  - 53-62

AB  - A novel thermostable NAD(P)H oxidase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon 
      Thermococcus kodakarensis KOD1 (TkNOX) catalyzes oxidation of NADH and NADPH with 
      oxygen from atmospheric air as an electron acceptor. Although the optimal 
      temperature of TkNOX is >90°C, it also shows activity at 30°C. This enzyme was used 
      for the regeneration of both NADP(+) and NAD(+) in alcohol dehydrogenase 
      (ADH)-catalyzed enantioselective oxidation of racemic 1-phenylethanol. NADP(+) 
      regeneration at 30°C was performed by TkNOX coupled with (R)-specific ADH from 
      Lactobacillus kefir, resulting in successful acquisition of optically pure 
      (S)-1-phenylethanol. The use of TkNOX with moderately thermostable (S)-specific ADH 
      from Rhodococcus erythropolis enabled us to operate the enantioselective 
      bioconversion accompanying NAD(+) regeneration at high temperatures. Optically pure 
      (R)-1-phenylethanol was successfully obtained by this system after a shorter 
      reaction time at 45-60°C than that at 30°C, demonstrating an advantage of the 
      combination of thermostable enzymes. The ability of TkNOX to oxidize both NADH and 
      NADPH with remarkable thermostability renders this enzyme a versatile tool for 
      regeneration of the oxidized nicotinamide cofactors without the need for extra 
      substrates other than dissolved oxygen from air.

TI  - Anaerobic conversion of lactic acid to acetic acid and 1, 2-propanediol by 
      Lactobacillus buchneri.
PG  - 125-32
AB  - The degradation of lactic acid under anoxic conditions was studied in several 
      strains of Lactobacillus buchneri and in close relatives such as Lactobacillus 
      parabuchneri, Lactobacillus kefir, and Lactobacillus hilgardii. Of these 
      lactobacilli, L. buchneri and L. parabuchneri were able to degrade lactic acid under 
      anoxic conditions, without requiring an external electron acceptor. Each mole of 
      lactic acid was converted into approximately 0.5 mol of acetic acid, 0.5 mol of 
      1,2-propanediol, and traces of ethanol. Based on stoichiometry studies and the high 
      levels of NAD-linked 1, 2-propanediol-dependent oxidoreductase (530 to 790 nmol 
      min(-1) mg of protein(-1)), a novel pathway for anaerobic lactic acid degradation is 
      proposed. The anaerobic degradation of lactic acid by L. buchneri does not support 
      cell growth and is pH dependent. Acidic conditions are needed to induce the 
      lactic-acid-degrading capacity of the cells and to maintain the 
      lactic-acid-degrading activity. At a pH above 5.8 hardly any lactic acid degradation 
      was observed. The exact function of anaerobic lactic acid degradation by L. buchneri 
      is not certain, but some results indicate that it plays a role in maintaining cell 
      viability.

AB  - The relationships between chemical, textural, rheological and microstructural 
      properties of low fat mozzarella cheese incorporated with different ratios of 
      inulin/kefiran mixture were studied. By increasing inulin content, the protein and 
      moisture content was increased and as a result, the meltability was reduced. 
      Although, textural properties of low-fat mozzarella was completely influenced by 
      inulin incorporation and hardness was increased, but the lower springiness and 
      higher cohesiveness of cheese was achieved at high level of inulin which may be 
      related to the increase in moisture and protein. Rheological properties of low-fat 
      mozzarella cheese confirmed its shear-thinning behavior in which the G' value was 
      more than G″. Mechanical properties of cheese showed that inulin incorporation into 
      cheese did not significantly change the rheological properties of the cheese matrix. 
      Consequently, the formation of a more rigid and cross-linked protein structure which 
      is less plasticized achieved at high inulin incorporation through keeping more water 
      and protein and less fat content. SEM results indicated the sponge honeycomb 
      structure of mozzarella cheese which clearly confirmed the textural and rheological 
      properties and there was an interrelationship among chemical, textural, rheological 
      and microstructural properties of low-fat mozzarella cheese incorporated at 
      different ratios of inulin.

TI  - Detailed Structural Characterization of Glucans Produced by Glucansucrases from 
      Leuconostoc citreum TMW 2.1194.
PG  - 6856-6866
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.9b01822 [doi]
AB  - The water kefir organism Leuconostoc citreum TMW 2.1194 forms highly branched 
      dextrans with O3- and O4-bound side chains. To obtain detailed information on the 
      enzymatic synthesis of these polymers, the four glucansucrases encoded by 
      Leuconostoc citreum TMW 2.1194 were cloned, heterologously expressed, and used for 
      polysaccharide production. Molecular and macromolecular structure of the synthesized 
      glucans were analyzed by methylation analysis, two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy, 
      oligosaccharide analysis after partial hydrolysis, and asymmetric flow field-flow 
      fractionation. It was demonstrated that two glucansucrases form insoluble glucans 
      with variously branched dextran sections and varying portions of consecutive, 
      1,3-linked glucose units. In contrast, the other two glucansucrases synthesized O3- 
      (Lc6255) and O4-branched (Lc1785) soluble dextrans. Analysis, isolation, and 
      characterization of enzymatically liberated oligosaccharides showed that monomeric 
      and elongated side chains are abundant in both polysaccharides. From the structures 
      and size distributions it was concluded that Lc1785 is mainly responsible for 
      synthesis of fermentatively produced soluble dextrans.

TI  - Discarded oranges and brewer's spent grains as promoting ingredients for microbial 
      growth by submerged and solid state fermentation of agro-industrial waste mixtures.
PG  - 1885-95
LID - 10.1007/s12010-013-0313-0 [doi]
AB  - The exploitation of various agro-industrial wastes for microbial cell mass 
      production of Kluyveromyces marxianus, kefir, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae is 
      reported in the present investigation. Specifically, the promotional effect of whole 
      orange pulp on cell growth in mixtures consisting of cheese whey, molasses, and 
      potato pulp in submerged fermentation processes was examined. A 2- to 3-fold 
      increase of cell mass was observed in the presence of orange pulp. Likewise, the 
      promotional effect of brewer's spent grains on cell growth in solid state 
      fermentation of mixtures of whey, molasses, potato pulp, malt spent rootlets, and 
      orange pulp was examined. The cell mass was increased by 3-fold for K. marxianus and 
      2-fold for S. cerevisiae in the presence of these substrates, proving their 
      suitability for single-cell protein production without the need for extra nutrients. 
      Cell growth kinetics were also studied by measurements of cell counts at various 
      time intervals at different concentrations of added orange pulp. The protein content 
      of the fermented substrates was increased substantially, indicating potential use of 
      mixed agro-industrial wastes of negligible cost, as protein-enriched livestock feed, 
      achieving at the same time creation of added value and waste minimization.

TI  - Assembling a cellulase cocktail and a cellodextrin transporter into a yeast host for 
      CBP ethanol production.
PG  - 19
LID - 10.1186/1754-6834-6-19 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many microorganisms possess enzymes that can efficiently degrade 
      lignocellulosic materials, but do not have the capability to produce a large amount 
      of ethanol. Thus, attempts have been made to transform such enzymes into 
      fermentative microbes to serve as hosts for ethanol production. However, an 
      efficient host for a consolidated bioprocess (CBP) remains to be found. For this 
      purpose, a synthetic biology technique that can transform multiple genes into a 
      genome is instrumental. Moreover, a strategy to select cellulases that interact 
      synergistically is needed. RESULTS: To engineer a yeast for CBP bio-ethanol 
      production, a synthetic biology technique, called "promoter-based gene assembly and 
      simultaneous overexpression" (PGASO), that can simultaneously transform and express 
      multiple genes in a kefir yeast, Kluyveromyces marxianus KY3, was recently 
      developed. To formulate an efficient cellulase cocktail, a filter-paper-activity 
      assay for selecting heterologous cellulolytic enzymes was established in this study 
      and used to select five cellulase genes, including two cellobiohydrolases, two 
      endo-β-1,4-glucanases and one beta-glucosidase genes from different fungi. In 
      addition, a fungal cellodextrin transporter gene was chosen to transport 
      cellodextrin into the cytoplasm. These six genes plus a selection marker gene were 
      one-step assembled into the KY3 genome using PGASO. Our experimental data showed 
      that the recombinant strain KR7 could express the five heterologous cellulase genes 
      and that KR7 could convert crystalline cellulose into ethanol. CONCLUSION: Seven 
      heterologous genes, including five cellulases, a cellodextrin transporter and a 
      selection marker, were simultaneously transformed into the KY3 genome to derive a 
      new strain, KR7, which could directly convert cellulose to ethanol. The present 
      study demonstrates the potential of our strategy of combining a cocktail formulation 
      protocol and a synthetic biology technique to develop a designer yeast host.

TI  - Binding of heterocyclic aromatic amines by lactic acid bacteria: results of a 
      comprehensive screening trial.
PG  - 322-9
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.200700034 [doi]
AB  - Aim of the present study was a comprehensive investigation of the detoxification 
      capacities of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) towards heterocyclic aromatic amines (HCA) 
      formed during cooking of meat. It has been postulated that LAB prevent genotoxic 
      and/or carcinogenic effects of HCA in laboratory rodents and humans via direct 
      binding mechanisms. We measured the removal of the most abundant cooked food 
      mutagens (AalphaC, PhIP, IQ, MeIQx, DiMeIQx) by eight LAB species. From each 
      species, twelve strains were tested in liquid binding experiments with HPLC coupled 
      with coulometric electrode array detection. The highest removal rates were observed 
      with the representatives of the L. helveticus and S. thermophilus groups, which were 
      seven to eight times more effective than L. kefir and L. plantarum. Strong and 
      statistically significant differences were seen in the binding behaviour of the 
      individual amines, the ranking order of detoxification being AalphaC > DiMeIQx > 
      MeIQx > IQ > PhIP. Results of Salmonella/microsome assays with strain TA98 showed 
      that the binding of AalphaC and PhIP to LAB correlates with the reduction of their 
      mutagenic activities. This study may contribute to the development of strategies 
      concerning the adverse health effects of HCA utilizing highly protective LAB for the 
      production of fermented foods.

TI  - Dominant lactic acid bacteria and their technological properties isolated from the 
      Himalayan ethnic fermented milk products.
PG  - 343-52
AB  - Ethnic people of the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, Bhutan and China consume a 
      variety of indigenous fermented milk products made from cows milk as well as yaks 
      milk. These lesser-known ethnic fermented foods are dahi, mohi, chhurpi, somar, 
      philu and shyow. The population of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) ranged from 10(7) to 
      10(8) cfu/g in these Himalayan milk products. A total of 128 isolates of LAB were 
      isolated from 58 samples of ethnic fermented milk products collected from different 
      places of India, Nepal and Bhutan. Based on phenotypic characterization including 
      API sugar test, the dominant lactic acid bacteria were identified as Lactobacillus 
      bifermentans, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. pseudoplantarum, Lactobacillus kefir, 
      Lactobacillus hilgardii, Lactobacillus alimentarius, Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. 
      paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Lactococcus 
      lactis subsp. cremoris and Enterococcus faecium. LAB produced a wide spectrum of 
      enzymes and showed high galactosidase, leucine-arylamidase and phosphatase 
      activities. They showed antagonistic properties against selected Gram-negative 
      bacteria. None of the strains produced bacteriocin and biogenic amines under the 
      test conditions used. Most strains of LAB coagulated skim milk with a moderate drop 
      in pH. Some strains of LAB showed a high degree of hydrophobicity, suggesting these 
      strains may have useful adhesive potential. This paper is the first report on 
      functional lactic acid bacterial composition in some lesser-known ethnic fermented 
      milk products of the Himalayas.

TI  - Hypolipidemic effect of lactobacillus ferment as a functional food supplement.
PG  - 1056-60
AB  - The Lactobacillus ferment used in this study was composed of Lactobacillus fermented 
      wheat, barley and kefir grains. Fermentation increased the CFU of lactic acid 
      bacteria with a reduction in pH value and in the contents of dietary fi ber and 
      glucan. Male SD rats were fed a high fat diet with or without 10% Lactobacillus 
      ferment for 4 weeks. In the Lactic-F group (group fed high-fat diet with 
      Lactobacillus ferment) there was a significantly reduced increase of body weight 
      compared with the HF-control (group fed high-fat diet without Lactobacillus 
      ferment). The food efficiency ratio (FER) tended to be decreased in the Lactic-F 
      group, but there was no significant difference between the Lactic-F and HF-control 
      groups. The perirenal and the epididymal fat weights in the normal dietary group 
      (control) and in the Lactic-F group were significantly lower than those of the 
      HF-control. The serum HDL-cholesterol and the total cholesterol in the Lactic-F 
      group were similar to the control group, and were significantly different from those 
      of the HF-control. These results indicated that the Lactobacillus ferment is a 
      functional material having antiobesity effects, with use as a supplement in 
      functional, health-favoring food.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Proper nutrition and balanced physical activity have a beneficial effect 
      on the growth and development of young athletes, supporting their endurance and 
      health, which is particularly important in the period of adolescence. OBJECTIVE: Aim 
      of this study was to assess eating behaviours, frequency of consumption of some food 
      products and selected elements of lifestyle among young dancers, as well as to 
      compare the age of the dancers and the assessed behavior. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The 
      study included 198 dancers aged 10-15 years. An originally developed questionnaire 
      was used as a research tool. RESULTS: The largest group of dancers (43%) spent on 
      training up to 2 hours per week. The recommended 4-5 meals/day were consumed by 
      61.1% of dancers, with 87.4% of respondents having breakfast on a daily basis. The 
      recommendations on the daily intake of several portions of fruit and vegetables were 
      followed by 49% and 36.9% of dancers, respectively. It is observed, that the 
      consumption rates of sweets increased, while the consumption rates of fruit 
      decreased with dancers'age. The consumption rates of packed lunch and afternoon 
      snack increased, whereas the consumption rates of dinner decreased with an 
      increasing number of hours spent training. CONCLUSIONS: Eating behaviours and the 
      frequency of consumption of food products by young dancers can be described as 
      varied. Their diet is characterised by regular consumption of meals and a correct 
      frequency of consumption of most food products, including high intake of fruit and 
      vegetables, yoghurt and kefir, as well as low consumption of fast food products. The 
      selected elements of dancers' lifestyle, such as sleep time and physical activity, 
      are mostly correct.

AB  - For the first time, polyaldehyde kefiran was applied to immobilize the pectinase on 
      the glass bead and the finding was compared with free enzyme. Polyaldehyde kefiran, 
      produced by periodate oxidation of kefiran, showed an aldehyde content of 
      23.6 ± 0.9% that was confirmed by FTIR. The results showed although the optimum 
      temperature (50 °C) was not changed by immobilization, the optimum pH was shifted 
      from 5.0 to 5.5. In optimal conditions, the specific activity of the free and 
      immobilized pectinase was 2.93 ± 0.13 and 1.87 ± 0.24 unit/mg, respectively. Also, 
      the immobilized pectinase had a higher thermal and pH stability than free enzyme. 
      K(m) and V(max) of the immobilized pectinase were higher and lower than the free 
      enzyme, respectively. In addition, SEM and AFM images illustrated a completely 
      non-uniform surface after enzyme immobilization on the glass bead, which seemed to 
      be related to the polyaldehyde kefiran strands.

TI  - Yogurt and other fermented foods as sources of health-promoting bacteria.
PG  - 4-15
LID - 10.1093/nutrit/nuy056 [doi]
AB  - Increased consumption of yogurt, kefir, and other fermented foods has been driven, 
      in part, by the health benefits these products may confer. Epidemiological studies 
      have shown that the consumption of fermented foods is associated with reduced risks 
      of type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and heart disease, along with improved 
      weight management. The microorganisms present in these foods are suggested to 
      contribute to these health benefits. Among these are the yogurt starter culture 
      organisms Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus 
      as well as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus strains that are added for their 
      probiotic properties. In contrast, for other fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, 
      kimchi, and miso, fermentation is initiated by autochthonous microbes present in the 
      raw material. In both cases, for these fermentation-associated microbes to influence 
      the gut microbiome and contribute to host health, they must overcome, at least 
      transiently, colonization resistance and other host defense factors. Culture and 
      culture-independent methods have now clearly established that many of these microbes 
      present in fermented dairy and nondairy foods do reach the gastrointestinal tract. 
      Several studies have shown that consumption of yogurt and other fermented foods may 
      improve intestinal and extraintestinal health and might be useful in improving 
      lactose malabsorption, treating infectious diarrhea, reducing the duration and 
      incidence of respiratory infections, and enhancing immune and anti-inflammatory 
      responses.

TI  - PGASO: A synthetic biology tool for engineering a cellulolytic yeast.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1186/1754-6834-5-53 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To achieve an economical cellulosic ethanol production, a host that can 
      do both cellulosic saccharification and ethanol fermentation is desirable. However, 
      to engineer a non-cellulolytic yeast to be such a host requires synthetic biology 
      techniques to transform multiple enzyme genes into its genome. RESULTS: A technique, 
      named Promoter-based Gene Assembly and Simultaneous Overexpression (PGASO), that 
      employs overlapping oligonucleotides for recombinatorial assembly of gene cassettes 
      with individual promoters, was developed. PGASO was applied to engineer 
      Kluyveromycesmarxianus KY3, which is a thermo- and toxin-tolerant yeast. We obtained 
      a recombinant strain, called KR5, that is capable of simultaneously expressing 
      exoglucanase and endoglucanase (both of Trichodermareesei), a beta-glucosidase (from 
      a cow rumen fungus), a neomycin phosphotransferase, and a green fluorescent protein. 
      High transformation efficiency and accuracy were achieved as ~63% of the 
      transformants was confirmed to be correct. KR5 can utilize beta-glycan, cellobiose 
      or CMC as the sole carbon source for growth and can directly convert cellobiose and 
      beta-glycan to ethanol. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first example of 
      multi-gene assembly in a single step in a yeast species other than Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae. We successfully engineered a yeast host with a five-gene cassette 
      assembly and the new host is capable of co-expressing three types of cellulase 
      genes. Our study shows that PGASO is an efficient tool for simultaneous expression 
      of multiple enzymes in the kefir yeast KY3 and that KY3 can serve as a host for 
      developing synthetic biology tools.

TI  - Enterococcus and Lactobacillus contamination of raw milk in a farm dairy 
      environment.
PG  - 243-51
AB  - Enterococci and lactobacilli are ubiquitously found in the intestinal microflora of 
      humans and animals. The aim of the present study was to determine the importance of 
      bovine faeces as a source of these organisms in raw milk. One hundred and fifty six 
      putative enterococci and 362 lactobacilli were isolated from bovine faeces (n=26), 
      cows' teats, raw milk, the milking machine and the milking environment on one farm. 
      The clonal relationships of each group were investigated using Pulsed-Field Gel 
      Electrophoresis and representatives of the different clusters were identified by 
      repetitive DNA element (rep)-PCR fingerprinting, protein profiling, 
      phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase (pheS) sequence analysis or 16S rDNA gene sequencing. 
      Lactobacilli were present at approximately 3 orders of magnitude greater than 
      enterococci in the bovine faeces. The majority of the bovine faecal enterococcal 
      isolates were identified as Aerococcus viridans. Seven teat isolates belonged to a 
      potential novel Aerococcus sp. and one bovine faecal isolate to a potential second 
      novel Aerococcus sp. The lactobacilli present in the bovine faeces were 
      predominantly Lactobacillus mucosae and Lactobacillus brevis, with small numbers of 
      Lactobacillus plantarum. Only one Enterococcus (a strain of E. casseliflavus) out of 
      76 and one Lactobacillus (a strain of L. parabuchneri/kefir) out of 247 of the 
      bovine faecal isolates was found in the milk. The major source of these bacteria in 
      the milk was the milking equipment.

TI  - Study of anti-inflammatory activity of Tibetan mushroom, a symbiotic culture of 
      bacteria and fungi encapsulated into a polysaccharide matrix.
PG  - 49-52
AB  - Tibetan mushroom (TM) is a fermented beverage composed by a dozen of bacteria and 
      yeasts living together into polysaccharide grains secreted by them. TM is similar to 
      kefir, a probiotic beverage originated in the Caucasian mountains exhibiting some 
      anti-bacterial, anti-mycotic, anti-neoplastic and immunomodulatory effects. Aiming 
      to evaluate a plausible anti-inflammatory property of TM we conducted cotton-induced 
      granuloma and paw edema assays in rats, the latter using carrageenin, dextran and 
      histamine as stimuli. TM samples were thawed and continuously cultured during 15 
      days into molasses solutions (50 g/l). The experiments used TM suspensions after 24h 
      fermentation and TM grains mechanically disintegrated. The results showed a 
      significant inhibition on the formation of granuloma tissue for the test group as 
      compared to the negative control group. TM suspensions presented an inhibition of 
      43% for the inflammatory process. Rat paw edema also showed significant decreases 
      with the mediators. The edema induced by carrageenin was inhibited 62% at the 3rd 
      hour. The edema dextran-induced was completely inhibited at 1h and antagonized the 
      histamine edema 52% at 1h.

TI  - Isolation, characterization, and molecular identification of Candida species from 
      urinary tract infections.
PG  - 33-36
LID - 10.18502/cmm.5.2.1159 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Candida species are reportedly the most common human fungal 
      pathogens. The incidence of urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by Candida 
      pathogens has increased in recent decades. However, such infections rarely occur in 
      the absence of any predisposing factors. Regarding this, the aim of the present 
      study was to identify the Candida species causing UTIs and determine the 
      predisposing factors for candiduria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study was 
      conducted on 1,450 urine samples obtained from patients suspected of UTI. Out of 
      this number, 19 cases were candidiasis, and 2 cases were mixed infections caused by 
      bacteria and fungi. Candida species were diagnosed differentially using the germ 
      tube test, colony staining on CHROMagar medium, intracellular beta-glucosidase 
      enzyme activity, and glucose absorption pattern. Then, the colonies with the same 
      morphology were confirmed by the DNA sequencing of internal transcribed spacer 
      regions. RESULTS: According to the results, 38%, 28.6%, 14.3%, and 9.5% of the 
      isolates were identified as C. albicans, C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, and C. kefir/C. 
      krusei, respectively. The presence of one or more predisposing factors was proved in 
      all patients in whom diabetes was the most prevalent predisposing factor (21.1%). 
      CONCLUSION: Based on the obtained results, C. albicans species was the most 
      prevalent fungal species. In addition, urinary fungal infections were less prevalent 
      than bacterial urinary infections.

TI  - Traditional low-alcoholic and non-alcoholic fermented beverages consumed in European 
      countries: a neglected food group.
PG  - 1-24
LID - 10.1017/S0954422416000202 [doi]
AB  - Fermented beverages hold a long tradition and contribution to the nutrition of many 
      societies and cultures worldwide. Traditional fermentation has been empirically 
      developed in ancient times as a process of raw food preservation and at the same 
      time production of new foods with different sensorial characteristics, such as 
      texture, flavour and aroma, as well as nutritional value. Low-alcoholic fermented 
      beverages (LAFB) and non-alcoholic fermented beverages (NAFB) represent a subgroup 
      of fermented beverages that have received rather little attention by consumers and 
      scientists alike, especially with regard to their types and traditional uses in 
      European societies. A literature review was undertaken and research articles, review 
      papers and textbooks were searched in order to retrieve data regarding the dietary 
      role, nutrient composition, health benefits and other relevant aspects of diverse 
      ethnic LAFB and NAFB consumed by European populations. A variety of traditional LAFB 
      and NAFB consumed in European regions, such as kefir, kvass, kombucha and hardaliye, 
      are presented. Milk-based LAFB and NAFB are also available on the market, often 
      characterised as 'functional' foods on the basis of their probiotic culture content. 
      Future research should focus on elucidating the dietary role and nutritional value 
      of traditional and 'functional' LAFB and NAFB, their potential health benefits and 
      consumption trends in European countries. Such data will allow for LAFB and NAFB to 
      be included in national food composition tables.

AB  - Biodegradable kefiran-whey protein isolate (WPI)-titanium dioxide (TiO2) blend films 
      were developed and characterized as a function of incorporating amount of TiO2 
      nanoparticles (1, 3 and 5% wt.). Results showed that the water vapor permeability, 
      moisture content, moisture absorption and water solubility decreased by increasing 
      the nano-TiO2 content. Mechanical tests revealed the plasticizing effect of TiO2 
      nanoparticles on the kefiran-WPI-TiO2 film. Addition of TiO2 nanoparticles to 
      kefiran-WPI films significantly decreased tensile strength and Young's modulus, 
      while increased its elongation at break. Differential scanning calorimetry data 
      indicated that the glass transition temperature significantly changed by adding 
      nano-TiO2. X-ray diffraction analysis also demonstrated that crystal type in 
      kefiran-WPI was not affected by incorporation of TiO2 nanoparticles. A uniform 
      distribution at 1 and 3% wt. loading levels of TiO2 nanoparticles was observed using 
      scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs.

TI  - Pretreatment-free immunochromatographic assay for the detection of streptomycin and 
      its application to the control of milk and dairy products.
PG  - 209-17
LID - 10.1016/j.aca.2011.06.001 [doi]
AB  - A rapid pretreatment-free immunochromatographic assay was developed for the control 
      of the streptomycin (STR) content in milk and dairy products. The assay is based on 
      the competition between an immobilized STR-protein conjugate and STR in a sample to 
      be tested for the binding to monoclonal anti-STR antibodies conjugated to colloidal 
      gold during the flow of the sample along a membrane strip with immobilized 
      reactants. It is possible to improve the cut-off level of positive and negative 
      samples distinguished by a change in the molar STR to protein ratio in the 
      immobilized conjugate. The cut-off level (500 ng mL(-1)) thus achieved corresponds 
      to the stated MRL of STR in milk and dairy products. For STR concentrations in the 
      range of 16-250 ng mL(-1) its content can be quantitatively measured based on the 
      degree of binding of a colloidal gold label in the test strip zone with the 
      immobilized STR-protein conjugate. The duration of the assay is 10 min. The selected 
      sizes of membrane pores and colloidal gold particles allow the assay to be carried 
      out at room temperature without additional reactants and pretreatment. The 
      applicability of the assay for milk, whole milk, sour clotted milk, and kefir with 
      different fat content (from 0.5% to 6%) was confirmed. The results of quantitative 
      immunochromatographic assay show good correlation with traditional ELISA (r was 
      equal to 0.935 and 0.940 for the series tested).

TI  - Screening of dairy yeast strains for probiotic applications.
PG  - 4050-6
AB  - To evaluate the potential of yeasts of dairy origin as probiotics, we tested 8 
      species including Candida humilis, Debaryomyces hansenii, Debaryomyces occidentalis, 
      Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces lodderae, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae, and Yarrowia lipolytica, isolated from commercial blue cheese and kefir. 
      Strains were randomly selected from each species and tested for their ability to 
      adhere to human enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells in culture. Among the 8 species, K. 
      lactis showed higher adhesive ability than K. marxianus, K. lodderae, and D. 
      hansenii. The other 4 species were poorly adhesive. All species other than K. 
      marxianus and C. humilis were resistant to acidic conditions. In the presence of 
      bile acid, growth inhibition was undetectable when incubation was carried out at 27 
      degrees C; however, it was evident for C. humilis and a strain of D. occidentalis 
      when incubated at 37 degrees C. Moreover, the influence of proteinase treatment of 
      living cells of K. lactis and K. lodderae on their adhesion to Caco-2 cells was 
      evaluated. Although a slight reduction was recognized when K. lactis was treated 
      with proteinase K, the influence of intestinal protease treatments of pepsin 
      followed by trypsin was negligible. These results indicated that a proteinaceous 
      factor was unlikely to be involved in adhesion of K. lactis and K. lodderae to 
      Caco-2 cells. No stimulation of IL-8 synthesis by Caco-2 cells was recognized in the 
      presence of K. lactis. In conclusion, K. lactis was the most attractive to continue 
      study for use as probiotic microorganisms.

TI  - Comparative analysis of zinc status, food products' frequency intake and food habits 
      of 11-year-old healthy children.
PG  - 963-8
AB  - Children are particularly vulnerable to zinc (Zn) deficiency during periods of rapid 
      growth and development such as infancy and adolescence. The aim was to find the 
      relationship between food frequency, intake, food habits and zinc status in 
      11-year-old healthy children from southern Poland. The study group comprised 
      children (n = 157) in the age range 11.0 +/- 0.4 years. The level of Zn in serum, 
      erythrocytes and hair samples was measured using atomic absorption 
      spectrophotometry. The parents of children examined completed a special food 
      frequency questionnaire. The Zn concentration in hair (boys 182.98 +/- 65.63 microg 
      x g(-1), n = 78; girls 203.82 +/- 39.80 microg x g(-1), n = 79; p = 0.0171), 
      erythrocytes (8.60 +/- 2.76 mg x l(-1), n = 50) and blood serum (0.79 +/- 0.15 mg x 
      l(-1)) correlated significantly (p < 0.05) with frequency intake of different 
      products (hair: meat, rolls, fruit juices without additives, brawn, pate, barley, 
      black pudding, fish canned, chips, margarine used for cooking, bacon; erythrocytes: 
      fruits, matured cheese, dishes of meal, white cottage cheese, fruit juices without 
      additives, cakes and cakes with cream, margarine used for bread spread; blood serum: 
      bread, fruits, milk, kefir, yoghurt). The relationship of the Zn amount in food 
      products, food frequency intake and the concentration in different healthy children 
      tissues is influenced by many internal and external factors.

TI  - Whole-Genome Sequences of Two Kazachstania barnettii Strains Isolated from Anthropic 
      Environments.
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evac007 [doi]
LID - evac007
AB  - Recent studies have suggested that species of the Kazachstania genus may be 
      interesting models of yeast domestication. Among these, Kazachstania barnettii has 
      been isolated from various microbially transformed foodstuffs such as sourdough 
      bread and kefir. In the present work, we sequence, assemble, and annotate the 
      complete genomes of two K. barnettii strains: CLIB 433, being one of the two 
      reference strains for K. barnettii that was isolated as a spoilage organism in soft 
      drink, and CLIB 1767, recently isolated from artisan bread-making sourdough. Both 
      assemblies are of high quality with N50 statistics greater than 1.3 Mb and BUSCO 
      score greater than 99%. An extensive comparison of the two obtained genomes revealed 
      very few differences between the two K. barnettii strains, considering both genome 
      structure and gene content. The proposed genome assemblies will constitute valuable 
      references for future comparative genomic, population genomic, or transcriptomic 
      studies of the K. barnettii species.

TI  - Acetobacter sicerae sp. nov., isolated from cider and kefir, and identification of 
      species of the genus Acetobacter by dnaK, groEL and rpoB sequence analysis.
PG  - 2407-2415
LID - 10.1099/ijs.0.058354-0 [doi]
AB  - Five acetic acid bacteria isolates, awK9_3, awK9_4 ( = LMG 27543), awK9_5 ( = LMG 
      28092), awK9_6 and awK9_9, obtained during a study of micro-organisms present in 
      traditionally produced kefir, were grouped on the basis of their MALDI-TOF MS 
      profile with LMG 1530 and LMG 1531(T), two strains currently classified as members 
      of the genus Acetobacter. Phylogenetic analysis based on nearly complete 16S rRNA 
      gene sequences as well as on concatenated partial sequences of the housekeeping 
      genes dnaK, groEL and rpoB indicated that these isolates were representatives of a 
      single novel species together with LMG 1530 and LMG 1531(T) in the genus 
      Acetobacter, with Acetobacter aceti, Acetobacter nitrogenifigens, Acetobacter oeni 
      and Acetobacter estunensis as nearest phylogenetic neighbours. Pairwise similarity 
      of 16S rRNA gene sequences between LMG 1531(T) and the type strains of the 
      above-mentioned species were 99.7%, 99.1%, 98.4% and 98.2%, respectively. DNA-DNA 
      hybridizations confirmed that status, while amplified fragment length polymorphism 
      (AFLP) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) data indicated that LMG 1531(T), 
      LMG 1530, LMG 27543 and LMG 28092 represent at least two different strains of the 
      novel species. The major fatty acid of LMG 1531(T) and LMG 27543 was C18 : 1ω7c. The 
      major ubiquinone present was Q-9 and the DNA G+C contents of LMG 1531(T) and LMG 
      27543 were 58.3 and 56.7 mol%, respectively. The strains were able to grow on 
      D-fructose and D-sorbitol as a single carbon source. They were also able to grow on 
      yeast extract with 30% D-glucose and on standard medium with pH 3.6 or containing 1% 
      NaCl. They had a weak ability to produce acid from d-arabinose. These features 
      enabled their differentiation from their nearest phylogenetic neighbours. The name 
      Acetobacter sicerae sp. nov. is proposed with LMG 1531(T) ( = NCIMB 8941(T)) as the 
      type strain.

AB  - Considering environmental pollution caused by the non-biodegradable polymers used in 
      food packaging, developing and enhancing the properties of biodegradable films seem 
      to be necessary. For this aim, in the present study, kefiran-whey protein isolate 
      bionanocomposite films were prepared and the impact of different concentrations (1, 
      3 and 5% w/w) of Al(2)O(3) (alumina) nanoparticles on their physical, morphological, 
      thermal and mechanical properties was studied. Based on the obtained results, an 
      increase in the nanoparticles content led to a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in 
      the water vapor permeability, moisture absorption, moisture content, and water 
      solubility. Scanning electron microscope images showed a homogeneous structure, 
      confirming the good dispersion of alumina nanoparticles with smooth surface up to 
      concentration of 3%. In addition, both thermal stability and mechanical properties 
      of the films were improved by the increased concentrations of alumina. The results 
      of X-ray diffraction indicated that the intensity of the crystalline peaks of film 
      increased with the addition of Al(2)O(3) to kefiran-whey protein isolate matrix. By 
      considering all results, the concentration of 3% was proposed as the appropriate 
      concentration of Al(2)O(3) for the nano-reinforcement of kefiran-whey protein 
      isolate bionanocomposites.

AB  - Alginate micro beads containing Lactobacillus kefiri (the principal bacteria present 
      in the kefir probiotic drink) were produced by a novel technique based on dual 
      aerosols spaying of alginate based solution and CaCl(2) as cross linking agent. 
      Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) has been also added to the alginate in order to change 
      the physic-chemical properties (viscosity and permeability) of the microbeads. 
      Calcium alginate and CMC are biopolymers that can be used for developing oral 
      drug-delivery systems. These biopolymers have been reported to show a pH-dependent 
      swelling behaviour. Calcium alginate and CMC have also been known to possess an 
      excellent mucoadhesive property. The loaded microbeads have been characterized in 
      terms of morphology, chemical composition and stability in different conditions 
      mimicking the gastric environment. In this study, we demonstrate the feasibility of 
      a continuous fabrication of alginate microbeads in a range of 50-70μm size, 
      encapsulating L. kefiri as active ingredient. The technique involves the use of a 
      double aerosols of alginate based solution and CaCl(2) as crosslinking agent. 
      Moreover, the encapsulation process was proved to be effective and not detrimental 
      to bacteria viability. At the same time, it was verified the protective efficacy of 
      the microcapsules against the gastric environment using both SGF pH1.2 (fasted 
      state) and pH2.2 (feed state).

AB  - In this study, the effect of different γ-ray dosages (3, 6, and 9 kGy) on the 
      functional properties of kefiran biopolymer was investigated. The obtained results 
      showed that increasing γ-ray dosage brought about an increase in the tensile 
      strength of film specimens up to three-times. However, elongation at break, and 
      tensile energy to break of γ-irradiated kefiran films decreased in the wake of 
      increasing γ-ray dosage. γ-Irradiation could improve surface hydrophobicity, 
      sensitivity of kefiran film specimens to water, and water vapor permeability, but 
      yellowness of films increased, simultaneously. XRD spectrum confirmed increased 
      crystallinity of γ-irradiated films. Melting point of films was constant but glass 
      transition temperature decreased drastically at high γ-ray dosage (9 kGy). ATR-FTIR 
      analysis confirmed that γ-ray engendered no changes in chemical functional groups. 
      According to the result, a mechanism was proposed to percept the effects of 
      γ-irradiation on kefiran biopolymer and its role on the functional properties of 
      kefiran film. Hence, the functional properties of kefiran films were depend on the 
      ratio of cross-linkages between polymer chains and produced mono and disaccharide by 
      γ-irradiation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: One-pot multi-step biocatalysis is advantageous over step-by-step 
      synthesis as it reduces the number of process operation units, leading to 
      significant process intensification. Whole-cell biocatalysis with metabolically 
      active cells is especially valuable since all enzymes can be co-expressed in the 
      cell whose metabolism can be exploited for supply of co-substrates and co-factors. 
      RESULTS: In this study, a heterologous enzymatic system consisting of ω-transaminase 
      and ketone reductase was introduced in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and evaluated for 
      one-pot stereo-selective conversion of amines to alcohols. The system was applied 
      for simultaneous kinetic resolution of racemic 1-phenylethylamine to 
      (R)-1-phenylethylamine and reduction of the ketone intermediate to 
      (R)-1-phenylethanol. Glucose was used as sole co-substrate for both the supply of 
      amine acceptor and the regeneration of NADPH in the reduction step. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      whole-cell biocatalyst was shown to sustain transaminase-reductase-catalyzed 
      enantioselective conversion of amines to alcohols with glucose as co-substrate. The 
      transamination catalyzed by recombinant vanillin aminotransferase from Capsicum 
      chinense proved to be the rate-limiting step as a three-fold increase in 
      transaminase gene copy number led to a two-fold increased conversion. The 
      (R)-selective NADPH-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus kefir proved 
      to be efficient in catalyzing the reduction of the acetophenone generated in the 
      transamination reaction.

AB  - This study aimed to develop a reliable analytical method for the determination of 
      melatonin and its isomers in various food products. The method entails ethanol 
      extraction of solid samples (or dilution of liquid samples) prior to liquid 
      chromatography coupled to triple quadruple mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of 
      target analytes. The method was in-house validated and successfully applied to 
      various food matrices. Recovery of melatonin from different matrices were found to 
      be 86.0 ± 3.6%, 76.9 ± 5.4%, 98.6 ± 6.4%, and 67.0 ± 4.5% for beer, walnut, tomato 
      and sour cherry samples, respectively. No melatonin could be detected in black and 
      green tea, sour cherry, sour cherry concentrate, kefir (a fermented milk drink) and 
      red wine while the highest amount of melatonin (341.7 ± 29.3 pg/g) was detected in 
      crumb. The highest amounts of melatonin isomer were detected in yeast-fermented 
      foods such as 170.7 ± 29.9 ng/ml in red wine, 14.3 ± 0.48 ng/ml in beer, and 15.7 ± 
      1.4 ng/g in bread crumb.

TI  - Enhanced kefiran production by mixed culture of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens and 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 43-53
AB  - In a batch mixed culture of Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens and Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae, which could assimilate lactic acid, cell growth and kefiran production 
      rates of L. kefiranofaciens significantly increased, compared with those in pure 
      cultures. The kefiran production rate was 36 mg l(-1) h(-1) in the mixed culture 
      under the anaerobic condition, which was greater than that in the pure culture (24 
      mg l(-1) h(-1)). Under the aerobic condition, a more intensive interaction between 
      these two strains was observed and higher kefiran production rate (44 mg l(-1) 
      h(-1)) was obtained compared with that under the anaerobic condition. Kefiran 
      production was further enhanced by an addition of fresh medium in the fed-batch 
      mixed culture. In the fed-batch mixed culture, a final kefiran concentration of 5.41 
      g l(-1) was achieved at 87 h, thereby attaining the highest productivity at 62 mg 
      l(-1) h(-1). Simulation study considered the reduction of lactic acid in pure 
      culture was performed to estimate the additional effect of coculture with S. 
      cerevisiae. Slightly higher cell growth and kefiran production rates in the mixed 
      culture than those expected from pure culture by simulation were observed. These 
      results suggest that coculture of L. kefiranofaciens and S. cerevisiae not only 
      reduces the lactic acid concentration by consumption but also stimulates cell growth 
      and kefiran production of L. kefiranofaciens.

AB  - In this study, the effect of UV-C light on starch-kefiran-ZnO (1%) primary solution 
      in different exposure times (1, 6, and 12 h) was investigated. Starch-kefiran-ZnO 
      (SKZ) solution was modified by UV irradiation in different time periods. Also, 
      nano-ZnO (ZN) was used as a photo-initiator and reinforcement agent, simultaneously. 
      Mechanical properties of the films were affected after the UV treatment. The tensile 
      strength increased because of the enhanced interaction between the biopolymer 
      mixture and nano filler but elongation at break was decreased. WVP decreased about 
      16% and dwindled to 2.08 × 10(-10) g m(-1) s(-1) Pa(-1). Water related properties 
      (i.e. moisture content, moisture absorption, and solubility in water) of the films 
      decreased by UV-C exposure. On the other hand, UV absorption and water contact angle 
      increased because of the better distribution of the ZNs in polymer matrix after the 
      UV exposure. Better compatibility of the ZNs and the biopolymer matrix after UV 
      treatment was confirmed by the SEM micrographs. Comparison of FTIR spectra before 
      and after UV exposure showed slight shifts. It was due to some formed or deformed 
      bonds inside of the nanocomposite matrix. The modified SKZ by UV could be an 
      appropriate process to sanitizing and food packaging concurrently. As well as UV can 
      be used as a nano-ZnO compatibilizer in food packaging materials.

AB  - Microbial cells are known to form aggregates. Such aggregates can be found in 
      various matrices; for example, functional drinks. Capillary hydrodynamic 
      chromatography (HDC) enables separation of particles by size using nanoliter-scale 
      volumes of samples. Here we propose an approach based on HDC for characterisation of 
      real samples containing aggregated and non-aggregated bacterial and fungal cells. 
      Separation of cells and cell aggregates in HDC arises from the parabolic flow 
      profile under laminar flow conditions. In the presented protocol, hydrodynamic 
      separation is coupled with different on-line and off-line detectors (light 
      absorption/scattering and microscopy). The method has successfully been applied in 
      the monitoring of dynamic changes in the microbiome of probiotic drinks. 
      Chromatographic profiles of yogurt and kefir samples obtained at different times 
      during fermentation are in a good agreement with microscopic images. Moreover, 
      thanks to the implementation of an area imaging detector, capillary HDC could be 
      multiplexed and used to profile spatial gradients in cell suspensions, which arise 
      in the course of sedimentation of cells and cell aggregates. This result shows 
      compatibility of sedimentation analysis and capillary HDC. We believe that the 
      approach may find applications in the profiling of functional foods and other 
      matrices containing aggregated bioparticles.

AB  - In this study, the metabolic activities (in terms of quantities of the produced 
      lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and exopolysaccharides) of 8 strains of 
      Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., and Pediococcus spp., were determined. Lactic 
      acid levels produced by strains were 8.1 to 17.4 mg/L. The L. acidophilus Z1L strain 
      produced the maximum amount (3.18 μg/mL) of hydrogen peroxide. The 
      exopolysaccharides (EPS) production by the strains was ranged between 173 and 378 
      mg/L. The susceptibility of 7 different antibiotics against these strains was also 
      tested. All strains were found to be sensitive to ampicillin. The tolerance of the 
      strains to low pH, their resistance to bile salts of strains, and their abilities to 
      autoaggregate and coaggregate with Escherichia coli ATCC 11229 were also evaluated. 
      High EPS-producing strains showed significant autoaggregation and coaggregation 
      ability with test bacteria (P < 0.01). A correlation also was determined between EPS 
      production and acid-bile tolerance (P < 0.05). EPS production possibly affects or is 
      involved in acid-bile tolerance and aggregation of Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus 
      spp., and Pediococcus spp. strains and supports the potential of L. acidophilus Z1L 
      strain as new probiotic.

AB  - The biocatalytic reduction of 4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-butyn-2-one to enantiopure 
      (R)-4-(trimethylsilyl)-3-butyn-2-ol was successfully conducted with high 
      enantioselectivity using immobilized whole cells of a novel strain Acetobacter sp. 
      CCTCC M209061, newly isolated from kefir. Compared with other microorganisms that 
      were investigated, Acetobacter sp. CCTCC M209061 was shown to be more effective for 
      the bioreduction reaction, and afforded much higher yield and product enantiomeric 
      excess (e.e.). The optimal buffer pH, co-substrate concentration, reaction 
      temperature, substrate concentration and shaking rate were 5.0, 130.6 mM, 30 degrees 
      C, 6.0 mM and 180 r/min, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, the maximum 
      yield and the product e.e. were 71% and >99%, respectively, which are much higher 
      than those reported previously. Additionally, the established biocatalytic system 
      proved to be efficient for the bioreduction of acetyltrimethylsilane to 
      (R)-1-trimethylsilylethanol with excellent yield and product e.e. The immobilized 
      cells manifested a good operational stability under the above reaction conditions 
      since they retained 70% of their catalytic activity after ten cycles of use.

      Healthy Dogs.

AB  - The increasing incidence of gastrointestinal tract pathologies in dogs and the 
      worrisome topic of antibiotic resistance have raised the need to look for new 
      therapeutic frontiers. Of these, the use of probiotics represents a potential 
      therapeutic alternative. Lactobacillus kefiri (Lk) is a species of Lactobacillus 
      isolated from kefir. Previous studies have demonstrated that its administration in 
      mice downregulates the expression of proinflammatory mediators and increases 
      anti-inflammatory molecules in the gut immune system. It also regulates intestinal 
      homeostasis, incrementing immunoglobulin A (IgA) secretion. Since Lk has never been 
      studied as a single probiotic in dogs, the aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      safety of Lk in dogs, and its effect on IgA secretion and on intestinal microbiota 
      composition. Ten healthy dogs without a history of gastrointestinal diseases were 
      included. The dogs received Lk at a dose of 10(7) live microorganisms orally, once 
      daily for 30 days. The fecal samples were tested before administration, in the 
      middle, at the end, and 30 days after discontinuation. The IgA secretion 
      concentration and the microbiota composition were evaluated on the fecal samples. 
      The results in this study suggested that Lk did not influence the concentration of 
      IgA, nor significant changes of the intestinal microbiota were observed during and 
      after the treatment. Therefore, additional studies are needed to investigate if a 
      higher daily dosage of Lk can influence the intestinal homeostasis of dogs.

TI  - In silico analysis of suitable signal peptides for secretion of a recombinant 
      alcohol dehydrogenase with a key role in atorvastatin enzymatic synthesis.
PG  - 17-26
LID - 10.22099/mbrc.2019.31801.1372 [doi]
AB  - An elevated cholesterol level might lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins 
      block the cholesterol synthesis pathway in the liver. Atorvastatin is the most 
      widespread statin worldwide and, its chemical synthesis requires toxic catalysts, 
      resulting in environmental pollution. Hence, enzymatic synthesis of atorvastatin is 
      desirable. This process could be done by Lactobacillus kefir alcohol dehydrogenase 
      (LKADH). Therefore, recombinant enzyme secretion by Escherichia coli using signal 
      peptides (SPs) might result in easy production and purification. To achieve this 
      objective, we used some online bioinformatics web servers to evaluate the suitable 
      SPs for translocation of LKADH into extracellular spaces. "Signal Peptide Website" 
      and "UniProt" were utilized to retrieve the SPs and LKADH sequences. "SignalP 4.1" 
      was used to determine SPs and their cleavage site location and the results were 
      rechecked by "Philius". Physicochemical features of SPs were evaluated by 
      "ProtParam", then solubility of their fusion with LKADH was assessed by 
      "Protein-sol". Finally, secretion pathway and sub-cellular localization of the 
      selected stable and soluble LKADH fusions were predicted by "PRED-TAT" and 
      "ProtCompB". Amongst the 41 evaluated SPs, only LPTA_ECOLI, SUBF_BACSU, CHIS_BACSU, 
      SACB_BACAM, CDGT_BACST and AMY_BACLI could translocate LKADH out of cytoplasm. The 
      six selected SPs in the result section were suitable to design a soluble secretory 
      LKADH that accelerate its scale-up production and might be useful in future 
      experimental researches.

AB  - Acetic acid bacteria (AAB) have, for centuries, been important microorganisms in the 
      production of fermented foods and beverages such as vinegar, kombucha, (water) 
      kefir, and lambic beer. Their unique form of metabolism, known as "oxidative" 
      fermentation, mediates the transformation of a variety of substrates into products, 
      which are of importance in the food and beverage industry and beyond; the most 
      well-known of which is the oxidation of ethanol into acetic acid. Here, a 
      comprehensive review of the physiology of AAB is presented, with particular emphasis 
      on their importance in the production of vinegar and fermented beverages. In 
      addition, particular reference is addressed toward Gluconobacter oxydans due to its 
      biotechnological applications, such as its role in vitamin C production. The 
      production of vinegar and fermented beverages in which AAB play an important role is 
      discussed, followed by an examination of the literature relating to the health 
      benefits associated with consumption of these products. AAB hold great promise for 
      future exploitation, both due to increased consumer demand for traditional fermented 
      beverages such as kombucha, and for the development of new types of products. 
      Further studies on the health benefits related to the consumption of these fermented 
      products and guidelines on assessing the safety of AAB for use as microbial food 
      cultures (starter cultures) are, however, necessary in order to take full advantage 
      of this important group of microorganisms.

AB  - A rapid ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical 
      ionization tandem mass spectrometric (UHPLC-APCI-MS/MS) method was developed for the 
      analysis of vitamin K compounds: phylloquinone (PK) and menaquinones (MK-n). 
      Non-chlorinated mobile phase composition was optimized for separation of eight 
      vitamin K compounds on a reversed phase column in 10 min. Sample treatment with 
      liquid and solid phase extractions and by the use of MK-4 as an internal standard 
      enabled the quantitation of microgram level of vitamin K compounds in food. The 
      method was used to screen and quantitate vitamin K from 17 fermented food products. 
      The highest amount of PK was detected in kimchi (42 µg/100 g), whereas the highest 
      MK-7 content was detected in natto (902 µg/100 g). Some MK-9 was present in kefir 
      (5 µg/100 g). Two Chinese fermented soybean pastes contained significant amount of 
      MK-6 (5-36 µg/100 g), MK-7 (12-86 µg/100 g), and MK-8 (22-44 µg/100 g).

AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) K25 is a probiotic strain isolated from 
      Tibetan kefir. Previous studies showed that this exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing 
      strain was antimicrobial active and cold tolerant. These functional traits were 
      evidenced by complete genome sequencing of strain K25 with a circular 3,175,846-bp 
      chromosome and six circular plasmids, encoding 3365 CDSs, 16 rRNA genes and 70 tRNA 
      genes. Genomic analysis of L. plantarum K25 illustrates that this strain contains 
      the previous reported mechanisms of probiotic functionality and cold tolerance, 
      involving plantaricins, lysozyme, bile salt hydrolase, chaperone proteins, 
      osmoprotectant, oxidoreductase, EPSs and terpenes. Interestingly, strain K25 harbors 
      more genes that function in defense mechanisms, and lipid transport and metabolism, 
      in comparison with other L. plantarum strains reported. The present study 
      demonstrates the comprehensive analysis of genes related to probiotic 
      functionalities of an EPS-producing L. plantarum strain based on whole genome 
      sequencing.

AB  - The history of the last 100 years of the science and technology of yogurt, sour 
      cream, cultured butter, cultured buttermilk, kefir, and acidophilus milk has been 
      one of continuous development and improvement. Yogurt leads the cultured dairy 
      product category in terms of volume of production in the United States and recent 
      research activity. Legal definitions of yogurt, sour cream and acidified sour cream, 
      and cultured milk, including cultured buttermilk, are presented in the United States 
      Code of Federal Regulations and summarized here. A tremendous amount of research has 
      been done on traditional and novel ingredients, starter cultures and probiotics, mix 
      processing, packaging, chemical aspects, physical and sensory properties, 
      microstructure, specialized products, composition, quality and safety of yogurt and 
      various manufacturing methods, addition of flavorings, viscosity measurements, and 
      probiotic use for sour cream. Over time, there have arisen alternative manufacturing 
      methods, flavor problems, addition of flavorings, and use of probiotics for cultured 
      buttermilk. Many health benefits are provided by yogurt and other cultured dairy 
      products. One hundred years of testing and development have led to wider uses of 
      cultured dairy products and new processing methods for enhanced shelf life and 
      safety. Future research directions will likely include investigating the effects of 
      probiotic dairy products on gut microbiota and overall health.

TI  - Cloning, Purification, and Characterization of a Heterodimeric β-Galactosidase from 
      Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens ZW3.

LID - 10.4014/jmb.1507.07013 [doi]
AB  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens ZW3 was obtained from kefir grains, which have high 
      lactose hydrolytic activity. In this study, a heterodimeric LacLM-type 
      β-galactosidase gene (lacLM) from ZW3 was isolated, which was composed of two 
      overlapping genes, lacL (1,884 bp) and lacM (960 bp) encoding large and small 
      subunits with calculated molecular masses of 73,620 and 35,682 Da, respectively. 
      LacLM, LacL, and LacM were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and these 
      recombinant proteins were purified and characterized. The results showed that, 
      compared with the recombinant holoenzyme, the recombinant large subunit exhibits 
      obviously lower thermostability and hydrolytic activity. Moreover, the optimal 
      temperature and pH of the holoenzyme and large subunit are 60°C and 7.0, and 50°C 
      and 8.0, respectively. However, the recombinant small subunit alone has no activity. 
      Interestingly, the activity and thermostability of the large subunit were greatly 
      improved after mixing it with the recombinant small subunit. Therefore, the results 
      suggest that the small subunit might play an important role in maintaining the 
      stability of the structure of the catalytic center located in the large subunit.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the effect of ZnO nanoparticles (ZN) as a 
      UV-protective agent of kefiran biopolymers. Our results showed that with increasing 
      ZN content, the tensile strength, elongation at break, and tensile energy to break 
      the kefiran film and nanocomposites also increased. Kefiran nanocomposites with a ZN 
      content higher than 2% produced a UV-protective film with good visual properties, 
      low sensibility to water, and low water-vapor permeability. The thermal properties 
      of all specimens, analyzed by DSC, showed that the ZN content had a negative effect 
      on Tg and a positive effect on nanocomposites' melting point. TEM, SEM micrography 
      and XRD spectrum analysis confirmed the hypothesis that ZNs act like a ball bearing, 
      making movement of kefiran chains easier and increasing elongation at break, while 
      simultaneously decreasing the Tg of kefiran nanocomposites.

TI  - Assessing survival of dairy propionibacteria in gastrointestinal conditions and 
      adherence to intestinal epithelia.
PG  - 423-32
AB  - The genus Propionibacterium consists of two principal groups, cutaneous and 
      classical or dairy. Cutaneous species are predominant members of the microbial 
      population of human skin and have also been isolated from the feces of humans and 
      other vertebrate animals. They are often considered opportunistic organisms and have 
      been occasionally associated with infections in humans. Dairy propionibacteria are 
      microorganisms extensively used in the industry for manufacture of Swiss-type 
      cheeses and biological production of propionic acid and vitamin B12. They can be 
      isolated from soil, vegetables, silage, raw milk, and dairy products such as kefir 
      and different cheeses with "eyes."In the last decade, several studies have 
      demonstrated probiotic properties for members of the genus Propionibacterium. The 
      effects claimed are based on the production of bacteriocins, vitamins, stimulation 
      of growth of other colonic bacteria like bifidobacteria, beneficial modification of 
      the composition and metabolic activities of the intestinal microflora, 
      immunomodulation, and antimutagenic activity. It is thought that to produce many of 
      these health benefits, the probiotic microorganisms must be able to survive the 
      transit through the hostile conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and 
      remain at high levels in the intestine, avoiding removal by peristaltic contractions 
      of the gut. In this sense, microorganisms with a short generation time or the 
      ability to adhere to the intestinal mucosa will survive for prolonged periods in the 
      body of the host. Therefore, two desirable properties for probiotic microorganisms 
      are (1) resistance to gastric acidity, bile, and pancreatic enzymes; and (2) 
      adhesion ability to mucosal surfaces. Dairy bacteria are traditionally not 
      considered to persist as normal inhabitants of the human intestinal tract. 
      Therefore, survival under GIT conditions and adherence are important properties to 
      be considered, and tests to study them would be useful tools. In the present chapter 
      we describe the methods used in our laboratory to assess survival, metabolic 
      activity, and adhesion of dairy propionibacteria to intestinal epithelial cells 
      after gastrointestinal digestion.

TI  - Effects of Antibacterial Peptide F1 on Bacterial Liposome Membrane Integrity.
PG  - 768890
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2021.768890 [doi]
LID - 768890
AB  - Previous studies from our lab have shown that the antimicrobial peptide F1 obtained 
      from the milk fermentation by Lactobacillus paracasei FX-6 derived from Tibetan 
      kefir was different from common antimicrobial peptides; specifically, F1 
      simultaneously inhibited the growth of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. 
      Here, we present follow-on work demonstrating that after the antimicrobial peptide 
      F1 acts on either Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (E. coli) or Staphylococcus aureus 
      ATCC 63589 (S. aureus), their respective bacterial membranes were severely deformed. 
      This deformation allowed leakage of potassium and magnesium ions from the bacterial 
      membrane. The interaction between the antimicrobial peptide F1 and the bacterial 
      membrane was further explored by artificially simulating the bacterial phospholipid 
      membranes and then extracting them. The study results indicated that after the 
      antimicrobial peptide F1 interacted with the bacterial membranes caused significant 
      calcein leakage that had been simulated by different liposomes. Furthermore, 
      transmission electron microscopy observations revealed that the phospholipid 
      membrane structure was destroyed and the liposomes presented aggregation and 
      precipitation. Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation (QCM-D) results showed 
      that the antimicrobial peptide F1 significantly reduced the quality of liposome 
      membrane and increased their viscoelasticity. Based on the study's findings, the 
      phospholipid membrane particle size was significantly increased, indicating that the 
      antimicrobial peptide F1 had a direct effect on the phospholipid membrane. 
      Conclusively, the antimicrobial peptide F1 destroyed the membrane structure of both 
      Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria by destroying the shared components of 
      their respective phospholipid membranes which resulted in leakage of cell contents 
      and subsequently cell death.

      Inflammation via Regulation of Proinflammatory Pathway and Tight Junction Integrity.

AB  - The aim of this study was to demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effect of 
      Lactobacillus kefirgranum PRCC-1301-derived extracellular vesicles (PRCC-1301 EVs) 
      on intestinal inflammation and intestinal barrier function. Human intestinal 
      epithelial cells (IECs) Caco-2 were treated with PRCC-1301 EVs and then stimulated 
      with dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Real-time RT-PCR revealed that PRCC-1301 EVs 
      inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in Caco-2 cells. PRCC-1301 
      EVs enhanced intestinal barrier function by maintaining intestinal cell integrity 
      and the tight junction. Loss of Zo-1, claudin-1, and occludin in Caco-2 cells and 
      the colitis tissues was recovered after PRCC-1301 EVs treatment, as evidenced by 
      immunofluorescence analysis. Acute murine colitis was induced using 4% DSS and 
      chronic colitis was generated in piroxicam-treated IL-10(-/-) mice. PRCC-1301 EVs 
      attenuated body weight loss, colon shortening, and histological damage in acute and 
      chronic colitis models in mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed that phosphorylated 
      NF-κB p65 and IκBα were reduced in the colon tissue sections treated with PRCC-1301 
      EVs. Our results suggest that PRCC-1301 EVs may have an anti-inflammatory effect on 
      colitis by inhibiting the NF-κB pathway and improving intestinal barrier function.

AB  - The aim of this study was to review microbiology results from testing >2500 raw 
      drinking milk and dairy products made with unpasteurised milk examined in England 
      between 2013 and 2019. Samples were collected as part of incidents of contamination, 
      investigation of infections or as part of routine monitoring and were tested using 
      standard methods for a range of both pathogens and hygiene indicators. Results from 
      testing samples of raw cow's milk or cheese made from unpasteurised milk for routine 
      monitoring purposes were overall of better microbiological quality than those 
      collected during incident or investigations of infections. Results from routine 
      monitoring were satisfactory for 62% of milks, 82% of cream, 100% of ice-cream, 51% 
      of butter, 63% of kefir and 79% of cheeses, with 5% of all samples being considered 
      potentially hazardous. Analysis of data from cheese demonstrated a significant 
      association between increasing levels of indicator Escherichia coli with elevated 
      levels of coagulase positive staphylococci and decreased probability of isolation of 
      Shiga toxin-producing E. coli. These data highlight the public health risk 
      associated with these products and provide further justification for controls 
      applied to raw drinking milk and dairy products made with unpasteurised milk.

AB  - Lactic acid bacteria have been reported to be capable of converting polyunsaturated 
      fatty acids, e.g. linoleic acid (LA) into bioactive and other fatty acid metabolites 
      that are not toxic to the bacteria themselves, but the mechanism of this conversion 
      is not clear. Here we reported for the first time that probiotic L. plantarum 12-3 
      derived from Tibet kefir when supplemented with LA from 1% to 10% in the MRS medium 
      transformed LA to various fatty acid derivatives. These derivatives formed in the 
      medium were identified with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. In silico 
      studies were done to confirm the enzymatic reactions responsible for this 
      conversion. We found that L. plantarum 12-3 could convert LA at different 
      concentrations to 8 different fatty acid derivatives. Putative candidate enzymes 
      involved in biotransformation of LA into fatty acid derivatives were identified via 
      whole genome of L. plantarum 12-3, including linoleate isomerase, acetoacetate 
      decarboxylase and dehydrogenase. Therefore, the present study provides further 
      understanding of the mechanism of conversion of LA to health-beneficial fatty acid 
      metabolites in probiotic L. plantarum, which can be explored for potential 
      application in functional foods.

TI  - Does Consumption of Fermented Foods Modify the Human Gut Microbiota?
PG  - 1680-1692
LID - 10.1093/jn/nxaa077 [doi]
AB  - The human microbiota is a key contributor to many aspects of human health and its 
      composition is largely influenced by diet. There is a growing body of scientific 
      evidence to suggest that gut dysbiosis (microbial imbalance of the intestine) is 
      associated with inflammatory and immune-mediated diseases (e.g., inflammatory bowel 
      disease and asthma). Regular consumption of fermented foods (e.g., kimchi, kefir, 
      etc.) may represent a potential avenue to counter the proinflammatory effects of gut 
      dysbiosis. However, an assessment of the available literature in this research area 
      is lacking. Here we provide a critical review of current human intervention studies 
      that analyzed the effect of fermented foods on the composition and/or function of 
      the human gut microbiota. A total of 19 human intervention studies were identified 
      that met this search criteria. In this review, we discuss evidence that consumption 
      of fermented foods may modify the gut microbiota in humans. Further, there is 
      cursory evidence to suggest that gut microbiota compositional changes mediate 
      associations between fermented food consumption and human health outcomes. Although 
      promising, there remains considerable heterogeneity in the human populations 
      targeted in the intervention studies we identified. Larger longitudinal feeding 
      studies with longer follow-up are necessary to confirm and enhance the current data. 
      Further, future studies should consider analyzing microbiota function as a means to 
      elucidate the mechanism linking fermented food consumption with human health. This 
      review highlights methodologic considerations for intervention trials, emphasizing 
      an expanse of research opportunities related to fermented food consumption in 
      humans.

TI  - Effects of Probiotics on Diabetic Nephropathy: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 234-242
LID - 10.2174/1574884715666200303112753 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic Nephropathy is a frequent complication of diabetes mellitus due 
      to functional and structural modifications in multiple kidney compartments. 
      Probiotics have risen lately as a forthcoming therapeutic intervention but they have 
      not been systematically evaluated in diabetic nephropathy so far. The aim of this 
      systematic review was to evaluate randomized controlled trials and experimental 
      studies assessing the effect of probiotic supplements on diabetic nephropathy. 
      METHODS: An extensive literature search was conducted through electronic databases 
      (PubMed, Scopus, Cinahl and Medline) with the Medical Subject Headings and entry 
      terms of "diabetic nephropathy", "diabetic renal disease" and "probiotics". The 
      search yielded 116 results, 9 of which met the inclusion criteria for this 
      systematic review. RESULTS: Most of the microorganisms used in the studies belonged 
      to the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genus. The dosage ranged from 2×107 to 
      6×1010 CFU/ g. The form of the probiotics varied across the studies (capsules, 
      sachets, soy milk, kefir and honey). The majority of the studies demonstrated the 
      benefits of probiotic supplementation on the reduction of inflammation, oxidative 
      stress and on the amelioration of renal function biomarkers in subjects with 
      diabetic nephropathy. No major gastrointestinal adverse events were observed during 
      the intervention time with probiotics. CONCLUSION: Findings of this systematic 
      review demonstrate the positive impact of probiotics on Diabetic Nephropathy without 
      any major adverse events. Moreover, future larger randomized controlled trials with 
      bigger samples and longer follow-up time are deemed necessary for further valid 
      results on the effectiveness of probiotic supplementation on Diabetic Nephropathy.

AB  - Biodegradable kefiran films, containing different concentrations of Al(2)O(3) 
      (alumina) (1, 3 and 5% w/w), were prepared by casting method and their physical, 
      mechanical, and thermal properties were studied. Based on the results, the increase 
      of the nano-Al(2)O(3) content led to a decrease in the water vapor permeability, 
      moisture content, moisture absorption, and water solubility. The addition of 
      nanoparticles did not affect the lightness of the films significantly (P > 0.05). 
      The mechanical tests revealed that the addition of Al(2)O(3) nanoparticles to the 
      kefiran films significantly increased both tensile strength and elastic modulus, 
      while had no effect on the elongation at break (P > 0.05). Thermogravimetric 
      analysis (TGA) indicated the improvement of the films' thermal stability by adding 
      alumina. The results of X-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the effect of Al(2)O(3) on 
      the semi-crystalline structure of kefiran. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images 
      approved a uniform distribution of nanocomposites containing 1 and 3% w/w of 
      Al(2)O(3). The obtained results suggested that Al(2)O(3) was able to improve the 
      characteristics of the kefiran-based films for using as food packaging material.

TI  - Adhesion properties of potentially probiotic Lactobacillus kefiri to 
      gastrointestinal mucus.
PG  - 16-23
LID - 10.1017/S0022029913000526 [doi]
AB  - We investigated the mucus-binding properties of aggregating and non-aggregating 
      potentially probiotic strains of kefir-isolated Lactobacillus kefiri, using 
      different substrates. All the strains were able to adhere to commercial gastric 
      mucin (MUCIN) and extracted mucus from small intestine (SIM) and colon (CM). The 
      extraction of surface proteins from bacteria using LiCl or NaOH significantly 
      reduced the adhesion of three selected strains (CIDCA 8348, CIDCA 83115 and JCM 
      5818); although a significant proportion (up to 50%) of S-layer proteins were not 
      completely eliminated after treatments. The surface (S-layer) protein extracts from 
      all the strains of Lb. kefiri were capable of binding to MUCIN, SIM or CM, and no 
      differences were observed among them. The addition of their own surface protein 
      extract increased adhesion of CIDCA 8348 and 83115 to MUCIN and SIM, meanwhile no 
      changes in adhesion were observed for JCM 5818. None of the seven sugars tested had 
      the ability to inhibit the adhesion of whole bacteria to the three mucus extracts. 
      Noteworthy, the degree of bacterial adhesion reached in the presence of their own 
      surface protein (S-layer) extract decreased to basal levels in the presence of some 
      sugars, suggesting an interaction between the added sugar and the surface proteins. 
      In conclusion, the ability of these food-isolated bacteria to adhere to 
      gastrointestinal mucus becomes an essential issue regarding the biotechnological 
      potentiality of Lb. kefiri for the food industry.

AB  - Methionine is one of the first limiting amino acids in poultry nutrition. The use of 
      methionine-rich natural feed ingredients, such as soybean meal or rapeseed meal may 
      lead to negative environmental consequences. Amino acid supplementation leads to 
      reduced use of protein-rich ingredients. The objectives of this study were isolation 
      of potentially high content methionine-containing yeasts, quantification of 
      methionine content in yeasts and their respective growth response to methionine 
      analogs. Minimal medium was used as the selection medium and the isolation medium of 
      methionine-producing yeasts from yeast collection and environmental samples, 
      respectively. Two yeasts previously collected along with six additional strains 
      isolated from Caucasian kefir grains, air-trapped, cantaloupe, and three soil 
      samples could grow on minimal medium. Only two of the newly isolated strains, K1 and 
      C1, grew in minimal medium supplied with either methionine analogs ethionine or 
      norleucine at 0.5% (w/v). Based on large subunit rRNA sequences, these isolated 
      strains were identified as Pichia udriavzevii/Issatchenkia orientalis. P. 
      kudriavzevii/I. orentalis is a generally recognized as a safe organism. In addition, 
      methionine produced by K1 and C1 yeast hydrolysate yielded 1.3 ± 0.01 and 1.1 ± 0.01 
      mg g(-1) dry cell. Yeast strain K1 may be suitable as a potential source of 
      methionine for dietary supplements in organic poultry feed but may require growth 
      conditions to further increase their methionine content.

PG  - e202200017
LID - 10.1002/cbic.202200017 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we developed a new bienzymatic reaction to produce enantioenriched 
      phenylethanols. In a first step, the recombinant, unspecific peroxygenase from 
      Agrocybe aegerita (rAaeUPO) was used to oxidise ethylbenzene and its derivatives to 
      the corresponding ketones (prochiral intermediates) followed by enantioselective 
      reduction into the desired (R)- or (S)-phenylethanols using the (R)-selective 
      alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) from Lactobacillus kefir (LkADH) or the (S)-selective 
      ADH from Rhodococcus ruber (ADH-A). In a one-pot two-step cascade, 11 ethylbenzene 
      derivatives were converted into the corresponding chiral alcohols at acceptable 
      yields and often excellent enantioselectivity.

TI  - Eating Fermented: Health Benefits of LAB-Fermented Foods.
LID - 10.3390/foods10112639 [doi]
LID - 2639
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are involved in producing a considerable number of 
      fermented products consumed worldwide. Many of those LAB fermented foods are 
      recognized as beneficial for human health due to probiotic LAB or their metabolites 
      produced during food fermentation or after food digestion. In this review, we aim to 
      gather and discuss available information on the health-related effects of 
      LAB-fermented foods. In particular, we focused on the most widely consumed 
      LAB-fermented foods such as yoghurt, kefir, cheese, and plant-based products such as 
      sauerkrauts and kimchi.

TI  - Food and Food Groups in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): The Design of the 
      Groningen Anti-Inflammatory Diet (GrAID).

AB  - Diet plays a pivotal role in the onset and course of inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD). Patients are keen to know what to eat to reduce symptoms and flares, but 
      dietary guidelines are lacking. To advice patients, an overview of the current 
      evidence on food (group) level is needed. This narrative review studies the effects 
      of food (groups) on the onset and course of IBD and if not available the effects in 
      healthy subjects or animal and in vitro IBD models. Based on this evidence the 
      Groningen anti-inflammatory diet (GrAID) was designed and compared on food (group) 
      level to other existing IBD diets. Although on several foods conflicting results 
      were found, this review provides patients a good overview. Based on this evidence, 
      the GrAID consists of lean meat, eggs, fish, plain dairy (such as milk, yoghurt, 
      kefir and hard cheeses), fruit, vegetables, legumes, wheat, coffee, tea and honey. 
      Red meat, other dairy products and sugar should be limited. Canned and processed 
      foods, alcohol and sweetened beverages should be avoided. This comprehensive review 
      focuses on anti-inflammatory properties of foods providing IBD patients with the 
      best evidence on which foods they should eat or avoid to reduce flares. This was 
      used to design the GrAID.

AB  - Several yeasts, which are eukaryotic microorganisms, have long been used in 
      different industries due to their potential applications, both for fermentation and 
      for the production of specific metabolites. Kluyveromyces marxianus is one of the 
      most auspicious nonconventional yeasts, generally isolated from wide-ranging natural 
      habitats such as fermented traditional dairy products, kefir grain, sewage from 
      sugar industries, sisal leaves, and plants. This is a food-grade yeast with various 
      beneficial traits, such as rapid growth rate and thermotolerance that make it 
      appealing for different industrial food and biotechnological applications. K. 
      marxianus is a respiro-fermentative yeast likely to produce energy by either 
      respiration or fermentation pathways. It generates a wide-ranging specific 
      metabolites and could contribute to a variety of different food and biotechnological 
      industries. Although Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most widely used dominant 
      representative in all aspects, many applications of K. marxianus in biotechnology, 
      food and environment have only started to emerge nowadays; some of the most 
      promising applications are reviewed here. The general physiology of K. marxianus is 
      outlined, and then the different applications are discussed: first, the applications 
      of K. marxianus in biotechnology, and then the recent advances and possible 
      applications in food, feed and environmental industries. Finally, this review 
      provides a discussion of the main challenges and some perspectives for targeted 
      applications of K. marxianus in the modern food technology and applied biotechnology 
      in order to exploit the full potential of this yeast which can be used as a cell 
      factory with great efficiency.

      Analysis.
PG  - 187-195

AB  - To understand the molecular mechanism involved in the survivability of cold-tolerant 
      lactic acid bacteria was of great significance in food processing, since these 
      bacteria play a key role in a variety of low-temperature fermented foods. In this 
      study, the cold-stress response of probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum K25 isolated 
      from Tibetan kefir grains was analyzed by iTRAQ proteomic method. By comparing 
      differentially expressed (DE) protein profiles of the strain incubated at 10°C and 
      37°C, 506 DE proteins were identified. The DE proteins involved in carbohydrate, 
      amino acid and fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolism were significantly 
      down-regulated, leading to a specific energy conservation survival mode. The DE 
      proteins related to DNA repair, transcription and translation were up-regulated, 
      implicating change of gene expression and more protein biosynthesis needed in 
      response to cold stress. In addition, two-component system, quorum sensing and ABC 
      (ATP-binding cassette) transporters also participated in cell cold-adaptation 
      process. These findings provide novel insight into the cold-resistance mechanism in 
      L. plantarum with potential application in low temperature fermented or preserved 
      foods.

AB  - Biodegradable kefiran-whey protein isolate (WPI) nanocomposites were produced using 
      montmorillonite (MMT) and nano-TiO2 as nanoparticles in the percentage of 1, 3, and 
      5% (w/w) by a casting and solvent-evaporation method. Physical, mechanical, and 
      water-vapor permeability (WVP) properties were determined as a function of 
      nanoparticle concentration. The results revealed that the effect of these 
      nanoparticles was different according to their nature and percentage. The films 
      incorporated with 5% (w/w) MMT showed the highest tensile strength, Young's modulus, 
      puncture strength, and the lowest WVP compared with the control and TiO2 added 
      films. In contrast to MMT, addition of TiO2 nanoparticles due to the plasticizing 
      effect led to a significant change in color and transparency of nanocomposite. 
      Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations demonstrated the films' properties 
      in relation to their microstructures. The surface topography results also showed a 
      considerable increase in roughness parameters by incorporating the nanoparticles in 
      kefiran-WPI matrix.

TI  - Saccharomyces unisporus: Biotechnological Potential and Present Status.
PG  - 353-363
LID - 10.1111/1541-4337.12016 [doi]
AB  -  The yeast species of the Saccharomyces genus have a long history of traditional 
      applications and beneficial effects. Among these presence of the Saccharomyces 
      unisporus has been documented in various dairy products and has become a subject of 
      interest and great importance. S. unisporus has shown a significant role in the 
      ripening of cheese and production of fermented milk products such as kefir and 
      koumiss. The absence of pseudohyphae during the life cycle of S. unisporus is an 
      indication of nonpathogenicity. Significance has been laid on the presence of S. 
      unisporus in food-grade products and a close proximity of S. unisporus to S. 
      florentinus and both of these species are accepted by the International Dairy 
      Federation and the European Food and Feed Cultures Association for food and feed 
      applications. Since over the years, S. unisporus has already become a part of 
      various dairy products, S. unisporus can be considered as a potential candidate for 
      generally regarded as safe status. S. unisporus has the capacity to convert 
      ketoisophorone to levodione, which is an important pharmaceutical precursor. S. 
      unisporus are considered as the potential producers of farnesol which eventually 
      controls filamentation of pathogenic microorganisms. Apart from that, S. unisporus 
      produces certain omega unsaturated fatty acids which combat diseases. Henceforth, 
      the areas which S. unisporus can be possibly exploited for its useful intermediates 
      are the enzymes and fatty acids it produces. In this context, this review attempts 
      to describe and discuss the ubiquity of S. unisporus in food products, cellular 
      composition, regulatory pathways, and its synthesis of fatty acids and enzymes.

TI  - Differences in dietary patterns between overweight and normal-weight adolescents.
PG  - 266-73
AB  - THE AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the differences in the dietary patterns of 
      Polish overweight and normal weight adolescents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study 
      was carried out on a group of 1906 pupils from gymnasium (lower secondary school) 
      aged 13-15 years, of whom 953 were overweight and 953 had normal body mass. The 
      sample was taken from a representative group of 8386 pupils. Their height and body 
      weight were measured, and their BMI was calculated. Overweight was defined as BMI 
      ł85 percentile for gender and age. Using the method of "selection in pairs", each 
      overweight pupil was paired with a pupil with normal body weight. The research tool 
      was a self-reported questionnaire, containing questions regarding how often selected 
      food products were usually consumed during the week, how regularly basic meals 
      (breakfast, lunch, supper) were eaten, and data on snacking. RESULTS: Overweight 
      adolescents consumed unhealthy products such as sweets and crisps significantly less 
      often than their peers with appropriate body mass. Overweight girls ate dark bread 
      significantly more often, and consumed soft drinks less often than their peers with 
      normal weight. Overweight adolescents had more irregular meals than those with 
      normal weight: only 44% overweight adolescents had breakfast every day, 
      significantly less than adolescents with normal weight. Nevertheless, overweight 
      teenagers snacked significantly less often than young people with normal body mass. 
      The overweight teenagers also less often chose snacks with high fat content, sugar 
      and salt, and more often vegetables, fruits, as well as yoghurt and kefir. 
      CONCLUSIONS: 1. Our study shows that compliance of low energy diet alone does not 
      ensure the maintenance of normal body weight. Irregularity of meals and breakfast 
      skipping play an important role in developing overweight and obesity in adolescents. 
      2. In future studies on dietary patterns in a larger sample of adolescents, emphasis 
      should be placed on adding questions about portion size, food preparation and meal 
      time. Eating behaviours of parents should be also examined in relation to their body 
      weight.

AB  - In this study, kefiran was esterified with octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA). The 
      esterification reaction variables including pH (8.5), kefiran concentration (5% 
      (w/w)), OSA concentration (12% (w/w)), temperature (~38 °C) and reaction time 
      (~80 min) were found as optimum points to achieve the maximum degree of substitution 
      (DS) (0.041 ± 0.002). Kefiran-OSA samples with DS of 0.021 (FDA suggested DS) and 
      0.041 (maximum DS) were prepared and compared with unmodified kefiran in all 
      experiments. FTIR and (1)H NMR spectroscopies proved the grafting of OSA on kefiran 
      structure. XRD analysis revealed that with increase in DS, the physical state of 
      kefiran to be more amorphous. In addition, the esterification modification led to a 
      decrease in the degradation temperature and an increase in the apparent viscosity 
      based on the obtained data from thermal analysis and viscosity measurement. The 
      results of the foaming and emulsifying properties confirmed the improvement in 
      surface properties of the modified kefiran. The frequency sweep test illustrated 
      that with an increase in DS, the viscoelastic behavior of the kefiran cryogels to be 
      more viscous. It can finally be stated that the modification with OSA was a high 
      potential strategy to extend the industrial applications of the kefiran.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of fear and anxiety on 
      nutrition during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Participants were recruited by an 
      online survey in this cross-sectional study. The questionnaire included general 
      demographic characteristics, level of fear and anxiety, and nutritional habits. The 
      Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 test (GAD-7) 
      were used to determine fear and anxiety. SETTING: Turkey. PARTICIPANTS: A total 
      sample consisted of 1012 adults. RESULTS: In pandemic, fear and anxiety caused 
      individuals to skip breakfast and snacks less, but more at lunch. A positive 
      significant correlation was observed between the increased consumption of yoghurt, 
      cheese and water and FCV-19S scores. There was a positive significant correlation 
      between cheese, legume, nuts-seeds, cake-cookies, dessert and tea consumption and 
      GAD-7 scores. A 1-unit increase in FCV-19S scores affected 1·04 times of increased 
      consumption of yoghurt, kefir, cheese, nuts-seeds, fruit (dry) and rice-pasta. A 
      1-unit increase in GAD-7 scores affected 1·03 times of increased consumption of egg 
      and fruit (fresh); 1·04 times of increased consumption of cheese and other 
      vegetables; 1·05 times of increased consumption of milk, meat, poultry, fish, 
      legume, nuts-seeds, fruit (dry), cake-cookies and tea; 1·07 times of increased 
      consumption of rice-pasta and coffee and 1·08 times of increased consumption of 
      bread and dessert. CONCLUSIONS: In pandemic, anxiety and fear led to changes in 
      individuals' nutritional habits and food preferences. Continuous surveillance of 
      psychological consequences for outbreaks should become routine as part of 
      preparedness efforts worldwide. In addition, the effects of these psychological 
      problems on nutrition should be evaluated.

TI  - iTRAQ-Based Quantitative Proteomic Analysis of the Antimicrobial Mechanism of 
      Peptide F1 against Escherichia coli.
PG  - 7190-7
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.5b00678 [doi]
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides have received increasing attention in the agricultural and 
      food industries due to their potential to control pathogens. However, to facilitate 
      the development of novel peptide-based antimicrobial agents, details regarding the 
      molecular mechanisms of these peptides need to be elucidated. The aim of this study 
      was to investigate the antimicrobial mechanism of peptide F1, a bacteriocin found in 
      Tibetan kefir, against Escherichia coli at protein levels using iTRAQ-based 
      quantitative proteomic analysis. In response to treatment with peptide F1, 31 of the 
      280 identified proteins in E. coli showed alterations in their expression, including 
      10 down-regulated proteins and 21 up-regulated proteins. These 31 proteins all 
      possess different molecular functions and are involved in different molecular 
      pathways, as is evident in referencing the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
      pathways. Specifically, pathways that were significantly altered in E. coli in 
      response to peptide F1 treatment include the tricarboxylic acid cycle, oxidative 
      phosphorylation, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and the cell cycle-caulobacter 
      pathways, which was also associated with inhibition of the cell growth, induction of 
      morphological changes, and cell death. The results provide novel insights into the 
      molecular mechanisms of antimicrobial peptides.

AB  - Mixed populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts and lactic acid bacteria occur 
      in many dairy, food, and beverage fermentations, but knowledge about their 
      interactions is incomplete. In the present study, interactions between Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, two microorganisms that 
      co-occur in kefir fermentations, were studied during anaerobic growth on lactose. By 
      combining physiological and transcriptome analysis of the two strains in the 
      cocultures, five mechanisms of interaction were identified. (i) Lb. delbrueckii 
      subsp. bulgaricus hydrolyzes lactose, which cannot be metabolized by S. cerevisiae, 
      to galactose and glucose. Subsequently, galactose, which cannot be metabolized by 
      Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, is excreted and provides a carbon source for 
      yeast. (ii) In pure cultures, Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus grows only in the 
      presence of increased CO2 concentrations. In anaerobic mixed cultures, the yeast 
      provides this CO2 via alcoholic fermentation. (iii) Analysis of amino acid 
      consumption from the defined medium indicated that S. cerevisiae supplied alanine to 
      the bacterium. (iv) A mild but significant low-iron response in the yeast 
      transcriptome, identified by DNA microarray analysis, was consistent with the 
      chelation of iron by the lactate produced by Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. (v) 
      Transcriptome analysis of Lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus in mixed cultures showed 
      an overrepresentation of transcripts involved in lipid metabolism, suggesting either 
      a competition of the two microorganisms for fatty acids or a response to the ethanol 
      produced by S. cerevisiae. This study demonstrates that chemostat-based 
      transcriptome analysis is a powerful tool to investigate microbial interactions in 
      mixed populations.

LID - 10.1007/s12088-019-00838-6 [doi]
AB  - Gioddu is the sole variety of fermented milk originating in Italy. Despite the long 
      history of consumption, Gioddu still represents an undisclosed source of microbial 
      diversity. The present study was aimed to get an insight into the bacterial and 
      fungal diversity of Gioddu samples collected from two artisan producers located in 
      Sardinia. To this end 3 batches of Gioddu were collected from each producer and 
      subjected to Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis 
      (PCR-DGGE) analyses. Gioddu was produced with sheep milk in accordance with the 
      local tradition. Regarding the bacterial population, a low biodiversity emerged. In 
      more detail, the sole species Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was 
      detected in all the samples, irrespective of the producer or the batch. A more ample 
      microbial diversity was highlighted for the fungal population that included closest 
      relatives to Pichia cactophila, Kluyveromyces marxianus and Galactomyces candidum. 
      Based on the results, the detected bacterial and fungal species generally clustered 
      in accordance with the producer, irrespective of the batch considered. It is 
      noteworthy that, Gioddu revealed several microbiological similarities with kefir 
      beverage, thus suggesting, by analogy, potential health benefits related to its 
      consumption. More research is needed to better clarify the microbiota composition of 
      Gioddu by using more powerful metagenomic techniques.

TI  - Insights into extracellular dextran formation by Liquorilactobacillus nagelii TMW 
      1.1827 using secretomes obtained in the presence or absence of sucrose.

AB  - Dextrans are α-(1,6)-linked glucose polymers, which are exclusively produced by 
      lactic acid bacteria from sucrose via extracellular dextransucrases. Previous 
      studies suggested that the environmental pH and the presence of sucrose can impact 
      the release and activity of these enzymes. To get deeper insight into this 
      phenomenon, the dextransucrase expressed by water kefir borne Liquorilactobacillus 
      (L.) nagelii TMW 1.1827 (formerly Lactobacillus nagelii) was recovered in 
      supernatants of buffered cell suspensions that had been incubated with or without 
      sucrose and at different pH. The obtained secretomes were used to time-dependently 
      produce and recover dextrans, whose molecular and macromolecular structures were 
      determined by methylation analysis and AF4-MALS-UV measurements, respectively. The 
      initial pH of the buffered cell suspensions had solely a minor influence on the 
      released dextransucrase activity. When sucrose was present during incubation, the 
      secretomes contained significantly higher dextransucrase activities, although the 
      amounts of totally released proteins obtained with or without sucrose were 
      comparable. However, the dextransucrase appeared to be released in lower amounts 
      into the environment if sucrose was not present. The amount of isolable dextran 
      increased up to 24 h of production, although the total sucrose was consumed within 
      the first 10 min of incubation. Furthermore, the sucrose isomer leucrose had been 
      formed after 10 min, while its concentrations decreased over time and the portions 
      of longer isomaltooligosaccharides (IMOs) increased. This indicated that leucrose 
      can be used by L. nagelii TMW 1.1827 to produce more elongated and branched dextran 
      molecules from presynthesized IMOs, while disproportionation reactions on short IMOs 
      may appear additionally. This leads to increasing amounts of high molecular weight 
      dextran in a state of sucrose depletion. These findings reveal new insights into the 
      pH- and sucrose-dependent kinetics of extracellular dextran formation and may be 
      useful for optimization of fermentative and enzymatic dextran production processes.

      lipopolysaccharides.

AB  - Kefiran is a water-soluble polysaccharide well recognized as a bioactive ingredient 
      to enhance nutritional and health-promoting features. Also, some therapeutic 
      properties have made this macromolecule an active ingredient in ointments and oral 
      anti-inflammatory drugs. However, the details of the molecular and cellular aspects 
      of these effects have not been addressed. In this study, lipopolysaccharides 
      (LPS)-induced monocytes, lymphocytes, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) 
      as representative cells for both innate and adaptive immunity were treated with 
      kefiran for 2 h. Kefiran had an anti-inflammatory effect on monocytes to reduce 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, interleukin 1 β (IL-1β) & tumor necrosis factor α 
      (TNF-α), as well as nuclear factor kappa b (NF-kb). However, it did not affect 
      lymphocytes. Overexpression of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in LPS-induced cells was 
      not reduced after kefiran treatment. Kefiran balanced MDDCs secretion of 
      pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines by reducing and enhancing the expression of IL-1β 
      and interleukin 10 (IL-10), respectively. Also, kefiran decreased the number of 
      apoptotic immature MDDCs and promoted dose-dependent phagocytosis capacity of MDDCs. 
      According to the results of the current study, it may be concluded that the 
      immunomodulatory effects of kefiran are due to antagonist against innate immune 
      receptors especially TLR4. The results of this study can be used as a guide to 
      developing kefiran-based non-aggressive anti-inflammatory drugs. Furthermore, 
      understanding the immunobiological effects of kefiran on monocytes and lymphocytes 
      was another outcome of this study.

LID - 10.1039/c8cc05304a [doi]
AB  - In this study, we present a concurrent chemo/biocatalytic one pot reaction cascade 
      by combining a metal (Pd/Cu) assisted Liebeskind-Srogl (L-S) coupling with an 
      enantioselective enzymatic reduction for the production of chiral amines and 
      alcohols. The latter transformation was realized by applying enantiocomplementary 
      alcohol dehydrogenases from Lactobacillus kefir (R-selective) and Rhodococcus ruber 
      (S-selective). Compatibility issues were solved by investigating first the 
      L-S-coupling protocol in water at room temperature. Subsequently, we investigated 
      two different biphasic systems and applied a biomimicking approach to separate 
      enzyme-deactivating components. By using a lipophilic membrane in a smart reactor 
      design, we were able to perform concurrent catalytic cascades with overall 
      concentrations up to 100 mM substrate and to produce 1-phenylethylamine and several 
      chiral alcohols in high yields (up to 81% over 2 steps) and enantiomeric purity ((+) 
      and (-)-enantiomers both with 99% ee).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of vulvovaginal 
      candidiasis (VVC) among patients with vaginitis, frequency of different Candida 
      species, and their susceptibility profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over six months 
      period, high vaginal swabs were cultured on Sabouraud's dextrose agar and isolates 
      were identified by culture on CHROMagar Candida and Vitek2 yeast identification 
      system or/and API 20C (BioMerieux, France). Antifungal susceptibility of the Candida 
      isolates was determined by E-test against amphotericin B, flucytosine, fluconazole, 
      voriconazole, posaconazole and caspofungin. RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred and 
      fifty-two women with vaginitis were screened for the prevalence of Candida spp. 
      Vaginal swab cultures of 231 (13.2%) women yielded Candida spp. The isolation rates 
      of different species were as follows: Candida albicans (73.9%), Candida glabrata 
      (19.8%), Candida kefir (1.94%), Candida tropicalis (0.96%), Candida parapsilosis 
      (0.96%), Candida krusei (0.96%), Candida guilliermondii (0.96%), and Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae (0.52%). All strains of C. albicans and non-C. albicans were susceptible 
      to most of the antifungal agents tested. CONCLUSION: The high frequency with which 
      C. albicans was recovered and its azole susceptibility support the continued use of 
      azole agents for empirical therapy of uncomplicated VVC. However, a larger 
      controlled study is required to determine the role of non-C. albicans in recurrent 
      VVC.

AB  - Lactobacilli are generally regarded as safe; however, certain strains have been 
      associated with cases of infection. Our workgroup has already assessed many 
      functional properties of Lactobacillus kefiri, but parameters regarding safety must 
      be studied before calling them probiotics. In this work, safety aspects and 
      antimicrobial activity of L. kefiri strains were studied. None of the L. kefiri 
      strains tested caused α- or β-hemolysis. All the strains were susceptible to 
      tetracycline, clindamycin, streptomycin, ampicillin, erythromycin, kanamycin, and 
      gentamicin; meanwhile, two strains were resistant to chloramphenicol. On the other 
      hand, all L. kefiri strains were able to inhibit both Gram(+) and Gram(-) pathogens. 
      Regarding the in vitro results, L. kefiri CIDCA 8348 was selected to perform in vivo 
      studies. Mice treated daily with an oral dose of 10(8) CFU during 21 days showed no 
      signs of pain, lethargy, dehydration, or diarrhea, and the histological studies were 
      consistent with those findings. Moreover, no differences in proinflammatory 
      cytokines secretion were observed between treated and control mice. No translocation 
      of microorganisms to blood, spleen, or liver was observed. Regarding these findings, 
      L. kefiri CIDCA 8348 is a microorganism isolated from a dairy product with a great 
      potential as probiotic for human or animal use.

TI  - Folate in Milk Fermented by Lactic Acid Bacteria from Different Food Sources.
PG  - 230-240
LID - 10.3746/pnf.2021.26.2.230 [doi]
AB  - Folates are essential micronutrients, and folate deficiency still occurs in many 
      countries. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are known to be able to synthesize folates 
      during fermentation, but the folate production is strain-dependent and influenced by 
      the fermentation medium, presence of a folate precursor, and fermentation time. This 
      study aimed to screen extracellular folate-producing LAB from local food sources and 
      evaluate the factors influencing their folate biosynthesis during milk fermentation. 
      The selection of folate-producing LAB was based on their ability to grow in 
      folate-free medium (FACM), with folate concentrations quantified by microbiological 
      assay. Growth of the 18 LAB in FACM varied between isolates, with only 8 isolates 
      growing well and able to synthesize extracellular folate at relatively high 
      concentrations (up to 24.27 ng/mL). The isolates with highest extracellular folate 
      levels, Lactobacillus fermentum JK13 from kefir granules, Lactobacillus plantarum 
      4C261 from salted mustard, and Lactobacillus rhamnosus R23 from breast milk, were 
      applied to milk fermentation. The last two isolates were probiotic candidates. The 
      three isolates consumed folate when it was present in the milk, and its consumption 
      was in line with their growth. The availability of folate precursors affected the 
      amount of folate consumed, but did not lead to increased folate concentrations in 
      the medium after 72 h fermentation. The results of this study indicate that these 
      isolates cannot be utilized for producing folate in folate-containing milk, as it 
      shows feedback inhibition on folate biosynthesis.

LID - 8853358
AB  - Milk products obtained from cow, goat, buffalo, sheep, and camel as well as 
      fermented forms such as cheese, yogurt, kefir, and butter are in a category of the 
      most nutritious foods due to their high contents of high protein contributing to 
      total daily energy intake. For certain reasons, high price milk products may be 
      adulterated with low-quality ones or with foreign substances such as melamine and 
      formalin which are added into them; therefore, a comprehensive review on analytical 
      methods capable of detecting milk adulteration is needed. The objective of this 
      narrative review is to highlight the use of vibrational spectroscopies (near 
      infrared, mid infrared, and Raman) combined with multivariate analysis for 
      authentication of milk products. Articles, conference reports, and abstracts from 
      several databases including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were 
      used in this review. By selecting the correct conditions (spectral treatment, normal 
      versus derivative spectra at wavenumbers region, and chemometrics techniques), 
      vibrational spectroscopy is a rapid and powerful analytical technique for detection 
      of milk adulteration. This review can give comprehensive information for selecting 
      vibrational spectroscopic methods combined with chemometrics techniques for 
      screening the adulteration practice of milk products.

AB  - Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii (S. boulardii) has been isolated from lychee 
      (Litchi chinensis), mangosteen fruit, kombucha, and dairy products like kefir. Dairy 
      products containing S. boulardii have been revealed to possess potential probiotic 
      activities owing to their ability to produce organic acids, essential enzymes, 
      vitamins, and other important metabolites such as vanillic acid, phenyl ethyl 
      alcohol, and erythromycin. S. boulardii has a wide spectrum of anti-carcinogenic, 
      antibacterial antiviral, and antioxidant activity, and is known to reduce serum 
      cholesterol levels. However, this yeast has mainly been prescribed for prophylaxis 
      treatment of gastrointestinal infectious diseases, and stimulating the immune system 
      in a number of commercially available products. The present comprehensive review 
      article reviews the properties of S. boulardii related to their use in fermented 
      dairy foods as a probiotic microorganism or starter culture. Technical aspects 
      regarding the integration of this yeast into the dairy foods matrix its health 
      advantages, therapeutic functions, microencapsulation, and viability in harsh 
      conditions, and safety aspects are highlighted.

TI  - Size-Dependent Variability in Flow and Viscoelastic Behavior of Levan Produced by 
      Gluconobacter albidus TMW 2.1191.
LID - 10.3390/foods9020192 [doi]
LID - 192
AB  - Levan is a fructan-type exopolysaccharide which is produced by many microbes from 
      sucrose via extracellular levansucrases. The hydrocolloid properties of levan depend 
      on its molecular weight, while it is unknown why and to what extent levan is 
      functionally diverse depending on its size. The aim of our study was to gain deeper 
      insight into the size-dependent functional variability of levan. For this purpose, 
      levans of different sizes were produced using the water kefir isolate Gluconobacter 
      albidus TMW 2.1191 and subsequently rheologically characterized. Three levan types 
      could be identified, which are similarly branched, but differ significantly in their 
      molecular size and rheological properties. The smallest levan (<10(7) Da), produced 
      without adjustment of the pH, exhibited Newton-like flow behavior up to a specific 
      concentration of 25% (w/v). By contrast, larger levans (>10(8) Da) produced at pH ≥ 
      4.5 were shear-thinning, and the levan produced at pH 5.0 showed a gel-like behavior 
      at 5% (w/v). A third (intermediate) levan variant was obtained through production in 
      buffers at pH 4.0 and exhibited the properties of a viscoelastic fluid up to 
      concentrations of 15% (w/v). Our study reveals that the rheological properties of 
      levan are determined by its size and polydispersity, rather than by the amount of 
      levan used or the structural composition.

AB  - While many bacteria have been used as probiotics by industries, only two yeasts, 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii and Kluyveromyces fragilis (B0399), have 
      been used for this purpose. In the present work, a total of 116 yeasts isolated from 
      Brazilian indigenous fermented food, cocoa fermentation, and kefir were in vitro 
      characterized for probiotic attributes. From 116 isolates, 36 were tolerant to 
      gastrointestinal conditions evaluated by tolerance to pH 2.0, bile salts (0.3% w/v), 
      and 37 °C temperature. From those, 15 isolates showed a similar or higher percentage 
      (P < 0.05) of hydrophobicity, autoaggregation, and coaggregation with E. coli than 
      the reference strain S. boulardii. All these strains showed a high percentage of 
      adhesion to Caco-2 cells (> 63%) and antioxidant activity (ranging from 18 to 62%). 
      Phytate hydrolysis was evaluated for these yeasts and 13 strains showed positive 
      results, which is important for nutrient availability in plant-based foods. These 
      results are important insights for characterization of novel probiotic yeast strains 
      as well as to aggregate functional value to these food products.

AB  - By screening for bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria of 1,428 strains 
      isolated from authentic Bulgarian dairy products, Lb. bulgaricus BB18 strain 
      obtained from kefir grain was selected. Out of 11 yogurt starters containing Lb. 
      bulgaricus BB18 and S. thermophilus strains resistant to bacteriocin secreted by Lb. 
      bulgaricus BB18 a yogurt culture (S. thermophilus 11A+Lb. bulgaricus BB18) with high 
      growth and bacteriocinogenic activity in milk was selected. Continuous (pH-stat 5.7) 
      prefermentation processes were carried out in milk at 37 degrees C in a 2l MBR 
      bioreactor (MBR AG, Zurich, Switzerland) with an IMCS controller for agitation 
      speed, temperature, dissolved oxygen, CO2 and pH. Prefermented milk with pH 5.7 
      coagulated in a thermostat at 37 degrees C until pH 4.8-4.9. S. thermophilus 11A and 
      Lb. bulgaricus BB18 grew independently in a continuous mode at similar and 
      sufficiently high-dilution rates (D=1.83 h(-1)-S. thermophilus 11A; D=1.80 h(-1)-Lb. 
      bulgaricus BB18). The yogurt cultures developed in a stream at a high-dilution rate 
      (D=2.03-2.28 h(-1)). The progress of both processes (growth and bacteriocin 
      production) depended on the initial ratio between the two microorganisms. The 
      continuous prefermentation process promoted conditions for efficient fermentation 
      and bacteriocinogenesis of the starter culture during the batch process: strong 
      reduction of the times for bacteriocin production and coagulation of milk (to 
      4.5-5.0 h); high cell productivity (lactobacilli-4x10(12) CFU ml(-1), 
      streptococci-6x10(12) CFU ml(-1)); high productivity of bacteriocins (4,500 BU 
      ml(-1))-1.7 times higher than the bacteriocinogenic activity of the batch starter 
      culture.

TI  - Origin of Lactose Fermentation in Kluyveromyces lactis by Interspecies Transfer of a 
      Neo-functionalized Gene Cluster during Domestication.

AB  - Humans have used yeasts to make cheese and kefir for millennia, but the ability to 
      ferment the milk sugar lactose is found in only a few yeast species, of which the 
      foremost is Kluyveromyces lactis [1]. Two genes, LAC12 (lactose permease) and LAC4 
      (lactase), are sufficient for lactose uptake and hydrolysis to glucose and galactose 
      [2]. Here, we show that these genes have a complex evolutionary history in the genus 
      Kluyveromyces that is likely the result of human activity during domestication. We 
      show that the ancestral Lac12 was bifunctional, able to import both lactose and 
      cellobiose into the cell. These disaccharides were then hydrolyzed by Lac4 in the 
      case of lactose or Cel2 in the case of cellobiose. A second cellobiose transporter, 
      Cel1, was also present ancestrally. In the K. lactis lineage, the ancestral LAC12 
      and LAC4 were lost and a separate upheaval in the sister species K. marxianus 
      resulted in loss of CEL1 and quadruplication of LAC12. One of these LAC12 genes 
      became neofunctionalized to encode an efficient lactose transporter capable of 
      supporting fermentation, specifically in dairy strains of K. marxianus, where it 
      formed a LAC4-LAC12-CEL2 gene cluster, although another remained a cellobiose 
      transporter. Then, the ability to ferment lactose was acquired very recently by 
      K. lactis var. lactis by introgression of LAC12 and LAC4 on a 15-kb subtelomeric 
      region from a dairy strain of K. marxianus. The genomic history of the LAC genes 
      shows that strong selective pressures were imposed on yeasts by early dairy farmers.

AB  - Kefiran-carboxymethyl cellulose biocomposite films incorporated with Satureja 
      Khuzestanica essential oil were developed and characterized. Results indicated that 
      increase in the concentration of the essential oil increased ultimate tensile 
      strength and contact angle but decreased elongation at break, moisture content and 
      water vapor permeability. It also significantly altered color parameters and the 
      percentage of light transmission in the visible and ultraviolet range. Fourier 
      transform infrared spectroscopy revealed the formation of hydrogen bonds between 
      polymer matrix and essential oil. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the 
      surface structure of the films was homogeneous without porosity. Increase in storage 
      modulus and glass transmission temperature in films incorporated with the essential 
      oil was observed through dynamic mechanical thermal analysis. Moreover, significant 
      increase in antioxidant properties and phenolic compounds were noticed. Ultimately, 
      results obtained from evaluation of antimicrobial characteristics of films indicated 
      their inhibitory effects against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli 
      bacteria.

TI  - Bioprocess development for kefiran production by Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens in 
      semi industrial scale bioreactor.

LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.06.003 [doi]
AB  - Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens is non-pathogenic gram positive bacteria isolated from 
      kefir grains and able to produce extracellular exopolysaccharides named kefiran. 
      This polysaccharide contains approximately equal amounts of glucose and galactose. 
      Kefiran has wide applications in pharmaceutical industries. Therefore, an approach 
      has been extensively studied to increase kefiran production for pharmaceutical 
      application in industrial scale. The present work aims to maximize kefiran 
      production through the optimization of medium composition and production in semi 
      industrial scale bioreactor. The composition of the optimal medium for kefiran 
      production contained sucrose, yeast extract and K2HPO4 at 20.0, 6.0, 0.25 g L(-1), 
      respectively. The optimized medium significantly increased both cell growth and 
      kefiran production by about 170.56% and 58.02%, respectively, in comparison with the 
      unoptimized medium. Furthermore, the kinetics of cell growth and kefiran production 
      in batch culture of L. kefiranofaciens was investigated under un-controlled pH 
      conditions in 16-L scale bioreactor. The maximal cell mass in bioreactor culture 
      reached 2.76 g L(-1) concomitant with kefiran production of 1.91 g L(-1).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of complementary and alternative medicine in inflammatory bowel 
      disease patients is progressively increased. AIM: To evaluate the use of 
      complementary and alternative medicine in inflammatory bowel disease patients and to 
      know potential risk factors for their use. The subjective response of these 
      therapies and the impact on treatment adherence were also evaluated. METHODS: 
      Prospective, descriptive and transversal study. Inflammatory bowel disease patients 
      were classified according to demographic and clinical characteristics. A 
      questionnaire about the use of complementary and alternative medicine was collected. 
      RESULTS: 705 patients were included. 126 patients (23%) had used complementary and 
      alternative medicine. The most commonly used was herbal remedies (n=61), homoeopathy 
      (n=36), acupuncture (n=31), kefir (n=31) and aloe vera (n=25). Factors associated 
      with its use were extraintestinal manifestations (OR 1.69, CI 95% 1.11-2.57) and 
      long-term evolution of the disease (OR 2.08, CI 95% 1.44-2.99). Most patients (74%) 
      had the subjective feeling that use of complementary and alternative medicine had 
      not improved their condition, 11 had adverse events related to its use and 11% of 
      patients discontinued their conventional drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Use of complementary 
      and alternative medicine in inflammatory bowel disease patients is frequent, 
      especially in those with extraintestinal manifestations and long-term evolution. The 
      use of these therapies was not perceived as a benefit for patients.

TI  - Kefiran reduces atherosclerosis in rabbits fed a high cholesterol diet.
PG  - 980-8
AB  - AIM: Kefiran is an exopolysaccharide produced by Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens, and 
      has been proposed to have many health-promoting properties. We investigated the 
      antiatherogenic effect of kefiran on rabbits fed a high-cholesterol diet. METHODS: 
      Male New Zealand White rabbits were fed a 0.5% cholesterol diet without (control 
      group, n = 7) or with kefiran (kefiran group, n = 8) for eight weeks. The aorta was 
      analyzed by histochemistry and atherosclerotic lesions were quantified. Lipids and 
      sugars in serum were measured. Foam cell formation of RAW264.7 by βVLDL derived from 
      both groups of rabbits was also investigated. RESULTS: Cholesterol, triglyceride and 
      phospholipids levels of serum and lipoprotein fractions were not significantly 
      different between these groups. Atherosclerotic lesions of the aorta in the kefiran 
      group were statistically lower than those of the control group, with marked 
      differences in the abdominal aorta. T-lymphocytes were not detectable in the aorta 
      of the kefiran group. Cholesterol contents in stools were almost identical in both 
      groups. Cholesterol content in the liver of the kefiran group was statistically 
      lower than in the control group. Galactose content of βVLDL derived from the kefiran 
      group was higher, and the lipid peroxidation level was much lower than in the 
      control group. RAW264.7 macrophages treated with βVLDL from the kefiran group showed 
      a more spherical shape and accumulated statistically lower cholesterol than 
      macrophages treated with βVLDL from the control group. CONCLUSION: Orally derived 
      kefiran is absorbed in the blood. Kefiran prevents the onset and development of 
      atherosclerosis in hypercholesterolemic rabbits by anti-inflammatory and 
      anti-oxidant actions.

TI  - Microbial exopolysaccharide production of Streptococcus thermophilus and its 
      antiquorum sensing activity.
PG  - 3331-3339
LID - 10.1007/s00203-021-02313-7 [doi]
AB  - Interest in the production of exopolysaccharides by microorganisms has increased in 
      the recent years. Using low-cost product is the main step of microbial production to 
      reduce cost and compete with chemical production. In this work, EPS production of 
      Streptococcus thermophilus isolates from yogurt (S2), kefir (S3), and S. 
      thermophilus ATCC 19258 (S1) isolate which was used as control strains were 
      investigated by using different fruit pulps. S. thermophilus isolates were 
      identified by morphological and 16S sequence analysis. The amount of EPS obtained 
      was measured spectrophotometrically using glucose as standard with phenol sulfuric 
      acid method. All three isolates produced higher amounts of EPS on M17 medium than 
      Nutrient medium. When the fruit pulp was added to the medium, EPS production 
      increased in all three isolates. When different nitrogen sources were added together 
      with fruit pulp juice, EPS production increased. The highest amount of EPS produced 
      by ATCC 19258 strain (21.570 mg/L) and S3 isolate (29.131 mg/L) is the medium where 
      mixed fruit pulp juice and nitrogen source is tryptophan. It has been shown that EPS 
      production is increased by adding fruit pulps to the prepared media. It is thought 
      that apricot pulp can be a good alternative in EPS production especially in the 
      evaluation of wastes. Also, antiquorum sensing activity of the highest amount EPS 
      was determined by using Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 strain and found effective 
      on violacein pigment inhibition and C6-AHL production of biosensor strain.

TI  - Structural characterization of the exopolysaccharide produced by Streptococcus 
      thermophilus 05-34 and its in situ application in yogurt.
PG  - C1226-30
LID - 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2011.02397.x [doi]
AB  - An exopolysaccharide (EPS) producing strain was isolated from Tibetan kefir grains 
      in China, which was identified by 16S rDNA tests and designated as Streptococcus 
      thermophilus 05-34. The high-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that 
      it was composed of galactose and glucose in a molar ratio of 1.0:0.8 with a 
      molecular mass of 2.5 × 10(4) Da. EPS was further revealed to have α-d-glucose, 
      α-d-galactose, β-d-glucose, and β-d-galactose by Fourier transform infrared 
      spectroscopy combined with 1D (1) H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The 
      length of EPS ranged from 10 to 100 nm and the maximal height of lumps was 2.5 nm 
      through atomic force micrograph analysis. Furthermore, yogurt fermented with 
      EPS-producing S. thermophilus 05-34 exhibited lower susceptibility to whey 
      separation, higher viscosity, and sensory scores than those made with 
      non-EPS-producing strain in yogurt production. These results suggested that 
      EPS-producing Streptococcus thermophilus 05-34 provided a potential application in 
      the fermented dairy industry.

AB  - In this study, we aimed to assess the feasibility of the lactic acid bacterium 
      Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens DN1 (LKF_DN1) and the yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus 
      KU140723-05 (KMA5), recently isolated from kefir, as probiotics. Specifically, we 
      evaluated the effect of early administration of these 2 microbes on the inhibition 
      of Salmonella Enteritidis (SE) colonization in neonatal chicks. We also examined the 
      effects of exposure of chicks to probiotics before SE exposure on the reduction in 
      the number of gut SE. A total of 108 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free male layer 
      chicks were used for 3 independent experiments. The experimental chicks were 
      randomly divided into 6 groups (negative control: basal diet [BD] without probiotics 
      and SE; positive control: BD; probiotic group [PG] 1: BD + LKF_DN1; PG2: BD + KMA5; 
      PG3: BD + LKF_DN1 + KMA5; and PG4: BD+ a commercial product IDF-7), all of which, 
      except negative control, were coadministered with SE strain resistant to rifampicin 
      (SERR). We found that the administration of LKF_DN1 and/or KMA5 reduced the number 
      of viable cells of the SERR strain in chicks by up to 1.90 log(10), relative to 
      positive control chicks. Compared with late administration (day [D] 10 and D11), 
      early administration (D1 and D2) of the probiotics was more effective in reducing 
      SERR cell numbers in the gut. Furthermore, we detected no significant difference in 
      the reduction of gut SERR cell numbers in chicks from the same groups exposed to the 
      probiotics at D10 and D11 before and after administration with SERR. Collectively, 
      our findings indicate that, as dietary additives, LKF_DN1 and KMA5 showed potential 
      probiotic activity in chicks. Moreover, the combination of the lactic acid bacteria 
      and/or yeast strain was found to rapidly reduce SE numbers in the chick gut and 
      showed a prolonged inhibitory effect against SE colonization. We, thus, propose that 
      the administration of these 2 probiotics, as early as possible after hatching, would 
      be considerably effective in controlling SE colonization in the guts of chicks.

      Lactobacillus fermentum M4, Lactobacillus casei M8 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus C1 
      from naturally-fermented tofu whey, along with Streptococcus thermophilus ST3 from 
      kefir XPL-1 fermented soymilk, to investigate their potential as starter cultures of 
      fermented soymilk. They were characterized for antibiotic susceptibility, probiotic 
      potential and their performance as starter cultures. All the LABs showed sensitivity 
      to the tested antibiotics. L. casei M8 had strongest tolerance to synthetic 
      gastrointestinal juice (<1.0 log CFU/mL loss), as well as antagonistic effects 
      towards five food-borne pathogens. GC/MS analysis showed that L. harbinensis M1 
      produced significantly higher abundance (P < 0.05) of 2,3-butanedione (2.45 ppm) and 
      acetoin (44.30 ppm), thus improving the overall sensory acceptability of fermented 
      soymilk. The coding genes for the synthesis of 2,3-butanedione/acetoin (alsS, alsD, 
      butA) were predicted from the whole-genome. A co-culture of L. harbinensis M1 and L. 
      casei M8 produced a fermented soymilk product with both markedly improved flavor and 
      good probiotic potential. It appears that L. harbinensis M1 has much potential for 
      improving the organoleptic properties of fermented soymilk.

AB  - The consumption of probiotics has increased due to the reported health benefits, 
      mainly in preventing or treating gastrointestinal pathology. This study investigated 
      the antimicrobial capacity of yeasts, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia kluyveri, 
      previously isolated from fermented foods (indigenous beverage, kefir and cocoa) 
      against the adhesion of foodborne pathogens to Caco-2 cells. Co-aggregation of 
      yeasts with pathogens and were evaluated by quantitative analysis and using scanning 
      electron and laser confocal microscopies. All yeasts strains were able to 
      co-aggregate with the tested pathogens, however, this activity was strain-dependent. 
      The inhibition tests showed that the adhesion of Escherichia coli EPEC, Listeria 
      monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis to Caco-2 was reduced by all the yeasts 
      studied. Most of the evaluated yeasts showed inhibition rates equal to or greater 
      than the commercial probiotic Saccharomyces boulardii. The yeasts were able to 
      reduce up to 50% of the bacterial infection, as observed for CCMA0615 towards EPEC 
      in exclusion assay; CCMA0731, CCMA0732 and CCMA0615 towards L. monocytogenes in 
      exclusion and competition assays; and CCMA0731 in exclusion and CCMA0731, CCMA0732, 
      CCMA0615 in competition assay towards S. Enteritidis. No antimicrobial compounds 
      were produced by the yeasts, showing that competition for nutrients and/or receptors 
      in the intestinal mucosa was the mechanism to bacterial inhibition.

AB  - Over the recent years, there is a growing interest in electrospun hybrid scaffolds 
      composed of synthetic and natural polymers that can support cell attachment and 
      proliferation. In this work, the physical and biological properties of polylactic 
      acid (PLA) electrospun mats coated with kefiran (Kef) were evaluated. Gravimetric, 
      spectroscopic (FTIR-ATR) and morphological investigations via scanning electron 
      microscopy confirmed the effective formation of a thin kefiran layer wrapped on the 
      PLA fibers with an easy-tunable thickness. Air plasma pre-treatment carried out on 
      PLA (P-PLA) affected both the morphology and the crystallinity of Kef coating as 
      confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction analyses. 
      Scaffolds were mechanically characterized with tensile tests to evaluate the 
      reinforcing action of the Kef coating. The water resistance of Kefiran coating in 
      distilled water at 37 °C evaluated on both PLA/Kef and P-PLA/Kef was carried out by 
      gravimetric and morphological analyses. Finally, cell culture assays with embryonic 
      fibroblast cells were conducted on selected hybrid scaffolds to compare the cell 
      proliferation, morphology, and collagen production with PLA and P-PLA electrospun 
      scaffolds. Based on the results, we can demonstrate that direct coating of PLA from 
      Kef/water solutions is an effective approach to prepare hybrid scaffolds with 
      tunable properties and that the plasma pre-treatment enhances the affinity between 
      PLA and Kefiran. In vitro tests demonstrated the great potential of PLA/Kef hybrid 
      scaffolds for skin tissue engineering.

TI  - Antibacterial action of peptide F1 against colistin resistance E. coli SHP45 
      (mcr-1).
PG  - 10231-10241
LID - 10.1039/d0fo01923b [doi]
AB  - The emergence of the plasmid-mediated colistin resistance mechanism (mcr-1) makes 
      bacterial resistance to colistin increasingly serious. This mcr-1 mediated bacterial 
      resistance to colicin is conferred primarily through modification of lipid A in 
      lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In our previous research, antimicrobial peptide F1 was 
      derived from Tibetan kefir and has been shown to effectively inhibit the growth of 
      Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli), Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus), 
      and other pathogenic bacteria. Based on this characteristic of antibacterial peptide 
      F1, we speculated that it could inhibit the growth of the colicin-resistant E. coli 
      SHP45 (mcr-1) and not easily produce drug resistance. Studies have shown that 
      antimicrobial peptide F1 can destroy the liposome structure of the phospholipid 
      bilayer by destroying the inner and outer membranes of bacteria, thereby 
      significantly inhibiting the growth of E. coli SHP45 (mcr-1), but without depending 
      on LPS. The results of this study confirmed our hypothesis, and we anticipate that 
      antimicrobial peptide F1 will become a safe antibacterial agent that can assist in 
      solving the problem of drug resistance caused by colistin.

LID - 10.1002/jemt.23923 [doi]
AB  - The purpose was to investigate the surface characteristics of various resin-based 
      materials by immersing in probiotic beverages. A total of 420 disc-shaped samples 
      (5 mm × 2 mm) were prepared from resin-based composites. Samples were divided into 
      four groups and immersed for 10 min/day for 1 month in either a probiotic sachet, 
      kefir, kombucha, or artificial saliva (control). Surface roughness was measured at 
      baseline and 1 month. One sample of each of the tested materials was examined under 
      nanoindentation to evaluate the reduced elasticity modulus and nanohardness scores. 
      Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to compare surface differences. Data 
      were analyzed statistically using one-way ANOVA test and the significance was set at 
      p < .05. The lowest roughness scores were observed in Z250, Estelite Bulk Fill, and 
      HRi ENA in most of the test groups. Among conventional composites, Z250 group had 
      the highest nanohardness and elasticity modulus scores. Among bulk-fill composites, 
      Estelite Bulk Fill Flow had the lowest surface roughness after immersion in 
      probiotic beverages and the highest nanohardness values. Reveal HD, as a bulk-fill 
      group showed higher surface roughness and considerably lower nanohardness and 
      elasticity modulus scores. Maximum height levels of samples were recorded. SEM 
      images revealed voids and microcracks on the surfaces of test materials. Dentists 
      may prefer Z250 as microhybrid and Estelite Bulk Fill Flow as bulk-fill composites 
      for the restorations of patients who consume gut-friendly drinks regularly. When 
      there are various types of materials, nanoindentation is a useful method for 
      evaluating surface alterations and sensible comparisons.

TI  - Study of the effect of the addition of plasticizers on the physical properties of 
      biodegradable films based on kefiran for potential application as food packaging.

AB  - Spectroscopies analysis indicated that kefiran contains branched hexasaccharide 
      repeating units. Neat kefiran films, 2 and 5% w/w of glycerol, d-glucitol, 
      d-galactitol, d-mannitol, and d-limonene were incorporated as plasticizers. Neat and 
      plasticized kefiran films were characterized by physical, thermal, mechanical, 
      optical, and water solubilization properties. Neat kefiran had a glass transition 
      temperature (T(g)) of -20 ± 2 °C and, with the addition of plasticizers between -15 
      to -17 ± 2 °C. The values were close to the neat kefiran, and the results could be 
      attributed to a lower amount of plasticizer used. The solubility of the glycerol 
      plasticized films increases by 33% and decreased with the concentration of other 
      plasticizers in comparison with the neat kefiran. d-glucitol and d-galactitol 
      decreased the microhardness and Young's Modulus of films around 30% and 74% 
      respectively, obtaining more flexible kefiran films. Kefiran based films could find 
      applications as potential materials in the food-packaging industry.

TI  - A novel kefir product (PFT) activates dendritic cells to induce CD4+T and CD8+T cell 
      responses in vitro.
PG  - 488-96

AB  - Lactobacilli have been widely studied for their probiotic effects and have been 
      reported to function as antiviral and anticancer agents. However, the underlying 
      mechanisms via immune modulation are poorly understood. PFT is a freeze dried 
      compound of Lactobacillus kefiri P-IF with a unique composition and functionality. 
      In this study, we examined the potential stimulatory effects of two concentrations 
      (50 µg and 100 µg/mL) of PFT on human monocyte-derived dendritic cell (DC) function 
      in vitro. Results showed that PFT upregulated the expression of DC surface 
      co-stimulatory and maturation markers CD80, CD86, and HLADR in a concentration 
      dependent manner. PFT at 100 µg/mL markedly increased the secretion of IL-6, IL-10, 
      TNF-α, and IL-1β by DCs. This concentration of PFT also stimulated the production of 
      antiviral cytokines, IFN-α and IFN-λ(IL29) in DCs. Additionally, PFT at 100 µg/mL 
      activated moDCs prime CD4(+)T cells and significantly increased the levels of IL-10, 
      IFN-γ, and TNF-α by 1.7, four, three-fold, respectively. Furthermore PFT-stimulated 
      DCs were also effective in enhancing the cytotoxic potential of CD8(+)T cells via 
      the induction of Granzyme-B and upregulation of CD107a, and CD103 expression, a 
      marker of resident/regulatory CD8(+)T cells. These data suggest that PFT functions 
      as a natural adjuvant for DC activation and thus may be used in DC-based vaccine 
      strategies against viral infections and cancer.

TI  - Role of probiotics in patients with colorectal cancer: a systematic review protocol 
      of randomised controlled trial studies.
PG  - e038128

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related 
      morbidity worldwide and it has been reported to be associated with poor lifestyle 
      habits which include excess tobacco and alcohol intake as well as genetics and age 
      factors. Probiotics such as the lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacterium as well as 
      probiotic containing foods (kombucha, kefir, miso etc) have received lots of 
      attention as anticancer agents for prevention and treatment. The effects of the 
      administration of probiotics to patients with colorectal cancer is the primary goal 
      of this systematic review. The overall aim is to assess how the use of probiotics in 
      patients with colorectal cancer helps in the management of colorectal cancer and its 
      effect on the diversity of gut microbiota. The final systematic review will provide 
      a comprehensive evidence base for the use and efficacy of probiotics in patient with 
      colorectal cancer care. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The systematic review, will be 
      conducted by extensively searching different databases such as PubMed, Web of 
      Science, Scopus, Wiley and ProQuest to identify randomised controlled trials (with 
      no time frame) which relate to the administration of probiotics to patients with 
      colorectal cancer. The search strategy will include words like colorectal cancer, 
      probiotics, Bifidobacterium, clinical trials etc. A systematic search of databases 
      was performed between 17 and 20 January 2020. Two reviewers will independently 
      review the studies and also search the reference lists of the eligible studies to 
      obtain more references. Data will be extracted from the eligible studies using 
      standardised data extraction form. After assessing the risk of bias, qualitative 
      analysis will be used to synthesise the systematic review. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: 
      This is a protocol for a systematic review; therefore, it doesn't require any ethics 
      approval. We intend to disseminate the protocol in a peer reviewed journal.

TI  - Practical two-step synthesis of enantiopure styrene oxide through an optimized 
      chemoenzymatic approach.
PG  - 8757-67
LID - 10.1007/s00253-016-7631-4 [doi]
AB  - Enantiopure styrene oxide (SO) and its derivatives are important building blocks for 
      chiral synthesis. In this study, we developed an attractive "1-pot, 2-step" 
      chemoenzymatic approach for producing enantiopure SO with 100 % theoretical yield. 
      This approach involved asymmetric reduction of α-chloroacetophenone by an alcohol 
      dehydrogenase (ADH; step 1), followed by base-induced ring closure (epoxidation) of 
      enantiopure 2-chloro-1-phenylethanol produced by the ADH (step 2). By-product 
      formation during epoxidation was suppressed to <1 % by adding methyl tert-butyl 
      ether (MTBE) as the second phase. Therefore, with this optimized approach, ADH from 
      Lactobacillus kefir (LkDH) successfully produced 1 M (S)-SO, with 99 % analytical 
      yield and 97.8 % enantiomeric excess (ee). In the preparation of (R)-SO, a 
      semi-rational strategy of active pocket iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM) was 
      successfully used to inverse the enantioselectivity of LkDH (muDH2, 
      F147L/Y190P/A202F/M206H/V196L/S96D/K97V), which produced the opposite enantiomer 
      (R)-2-chloro-1-phenylethanol. Through the optimized chemoenzymatic approach, muDH2 
      was successfully used to prepare 1 M (R)-SO, with 98.1 % ee and 99.0 % analytical 
      yield. Our results indicated that this optimized chemoenzymatic approach could be 
      used to produce both enantiomers of SO at concentrations as high as 120 g/L within 
      14 h, which is the highest concentration as far as we know. MuDH2 obtained through 
      ISM also showed reversed enantioselectivity toward another 13 aromatic ketones, 
      compared with wild-type (WT) LkDH. Furthermore, a molecular docking experiment 
      demonstrated that muDH2 inverted the binding orientation of the substrate, which may 
      be the reason for its inverse enantioselectivity.

TI  - Prophylaxis for mucositis induced by ambulatory chemotherapy: systematic review.
PG  - 735-46
LID - 10.1111/jan.12867 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of clinical trials 
      covering interventions used as prophylaxis for oral mucositis induced by ambulatory 
      antineoplastic chemotherapy. BACKGROUND: Oral mucositis in patients undergoing 
      chemotherapy is a side effect that can impact the quality of treatment and can 
      interfere with eating and therapeutic adherence. DESIGN: Quantitative systematic 
      review. DATA SOURCES: Relevant databases were searched, from January 2002-July 2013, 
      by using the combination of the keywords mucositis, stomatitis, neoplasms, 
      antineoplastic agents, drug therapy, prevention and control and chemotherapy. REVIEW 
      METHODS: Two researchers independently read the titles and abstracts from every 
      cross-reference. The quality of the included studies was analysed by the Jadad Scale 
      and the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool. Data were extracted from the 
      selected studies with a data collection form developed specifically for this 
      purpose. RESULTS: Of the 23 controlled clinical trials that were identified in this 
      study, five articles evaluated the use of oral cryotherapy to prevent oral mucositis 
      and three studies analysed the prophylactic use of glutamine. Interventions of 
      protocols for oral care, palifermin, allopurinol and chlorhexidine were evaluated by 
      two articles each. Interventions of zinc sulphate, amifostine, chewing gum, 
      sucralfate, recombination human intestinal trefoil factor, kefir and vitamin E were 
      evaluated by one article each. CONCLUSION: There is strong evidence that cryotherapy 
      can prevent oral mucositis arising from ambulatory treatment with 5-flurouracil 
      chemotherapy. Other interventions, although showing positive results in preventing 
      oral mucositis, require further study to confirm their conclusions.

AB  - Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO) genes play important roles 
      in CO2 fixation and redox balancing in photosynthetic bacteria. In the present 
      study, the kefir yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus 4G5 was used as host for the 
      transformation of form I and form II RubisCO genes derived from the nonsulfur purple 
      bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris using the Promoter-based Gene Assembly and 
      Simultaneous Overexpression (PGASO) method. Hungateiclostridium thermocellum ATCC 
      27405, a well-known bacterium for its efficient solubilization of recalcitrant 
      lignocellulosic biomass, was used to degrade Napier grass and rice straw to generate 
      soluble fermentable sugars. The resultant Napier grass and rice straw broths were 
      used as growth media for the engineered K. marxianus. In the dual microbial system, 
      H. thermocellum degraded the biomass feedstock to produce both C5 and C6 sugars. As 
      the bacterium only used hexose sugars, the remaining pentose sugars could be 
      metabolized by K. marxianus to produce ethanol. The transformant RubisCO K. 
      marxianus strains grew well in hydrolyzed Napier grass and rice straw broths and 
      produced bioethanol more efficiently than the wild type. Therefore, these engineered 
      K. marxianus strains could be used with H. thermocellum in a bacterium-yeast 
      coculture system for ethanol production directly from biomass feedstocks.

TI  - Growth Capacity of a Novel Potential Probiotic Lactobacillus paracasei K5 Strain 
      Incorporated in Industrial White Brined Cheese as an Adjunct Culture.

AB  - In this study, a novel potential probiotic strain Lactobacillus paracasei K5, 
      previously isolated from traditional Greek Feta cheese and kefir grains, was 
      evaluated as an adjunct culture for industrial white brined cheese production. 
      Targeting industrial applications, apart from free cell cultures, a novel 
      ready-to-use freeze-dried immobilized biocatalyst was prepared. The biocatalyst 
      composed of L. paracasei K5 cells immobilized on delignified wheat bran prebiotic 
      carrier and was freeze-dried without cryoprotectants. The adjunct free or 
      immobilized culture was added separately without prior adaptation during white 
      brined cheese manufacture and the produced cheeses were compared with commercial 
      white brined cheeses. Several parameters that affect the acceptability and quality 
      of the cheeses, including microbial populations, physicochemical parameters, 
      volatile by-products and organoleptic characteristics, were analyzed through 70 days 
      of storage. Results showed that the viability of the adjunct culture added either 
      free or immobilized remained in high levels (7 to 8 log cfu/g) during maturation and 
      storage. In addition, all white brined cheeses with the adjunct probiotic culture 
      showed a sharp decrease in spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms such as 
      enterobacteria, salmonella, staphylococci and coliforms during cheese maturation, 
      especially when compared with the commercial white brined cheeses. Finally, after 
      maturation time exceeded, all cheeses were characterized as safe for human 
      consumption. Cheeses volatile compounds were significantly enhanced by the 
      incorporated immobilized biocatalysts. These findings indicate the potential 
      industrial use of freeze-dried ready-to-use immobilized lactobacilli as 
      reinforcement adjunct cultures for the production of good-quality functional cheese 
      products. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The launch on market of novel foods developed by 
      the incorporation of functional ingredients provides potential benefits to 
      consumers' diet and new business opportunities for producers. Probiotic food 
      products are one significant category of functional foods. Thus, this study focused 
      on the development of a novel ready-to-use freeze-dried potential probiotic 
      biocatalyst for functional white brined cheese production. The potential industrial 
      application of such biocatalysts is highlighted by their incorporation as adjunct 
      cultures that resulted in good-quality functional cheeses.

AB  - Changes in present-day society such as diets with more sugar, salt, and saturated 
      fat, bad habits and unhealthy lifestyles contribute to the likelihood of the 
      involvement of the microbiota in inflammatory diseases, which contribute to global 
      epidemics of obesity, depression, and mental health concerns. The microbiota is 
      presently one of the hottest areas of scientific and medical research, and exerts a 
      marked influence on the host during homeostasis and disease. Fermented foods and 
      beverages are generally defined as products made by microbial organisms and 
      enzymatic conversions of major and minor food components. Further to the 
      commonly-recognized effects of nutrition on the digestive health (e.g., dysbiosis) 
      and well-being, there is now strong evidence for the impact of fermented foods and 
      beverages (e.g., yoghurt, pickles, bread, kefir, beers, wines, mead), produced or 
      preserved by the action of microorganisms, on general health, namely their 
      significance on the gut microbiota balance and brain functionality. Fermented 
      products require microorganisms, i.e., Saccharomyces yeasts and lactic acid 
      bacteria, yielding alcohol and lactic acid. Ingestion of vibrant probiotics, 
      especially those contained in fermented foods, is found to cause significant 
      positive improvements in balancing intestinal permeability and barrier function. Our 
      guts control and deal with every aspect of our health. How we digest our food and 
      even the food sensitivities we have is linked with our mood, behavior, energy, 
      weight, food cravings, hormone balance, immunity, and overall wellness. We highlight 
      some impacts in this domain and debate calls for the convergence of 
      interdisciplinary research fields from the United Nations' initiative. Worldwide 
      human and animal medicine are practiced separately; veterinary science and animal 
      health are generally neither considered nor inserted within national or 
      international Health discussions. The absence of a clear definition and subsequent 
      vision for the future of One Health may act as a barrier to transdisciplinary 
      collaboration. The point of this mini review is to highlight the role of fermented 
      foods and beverages on gut microbiota and debate if the need for confluence of 
      transdisciplinary fields of One Health is feasible and achievable, since they are 
      managed by separate sectors with limited communication.

AB  - The health-disease process can be influenced by the intestinal microbiota. As this 
      plays a fundamental role in protecting the organism, the importance of studying the 
      composition and diversity of this community becomes increasingly evident. Changes in 
      the composition of the intestinal bacterial community may result in dysbiosis, and 
      this process may contribute to triggering various diseases in all biological 
      systems. This imbalance of intestinal microbiota homeostasis may alter commensal 
      bacteria and the host metabolism, as well as immune function. Dysbiosis also causes 
      an increase in intestinal permeability due to exposure to molecular patterns 
      associated with the pathogen and lipopolysaccharides, leading to a chronic 
      inflammatory process that can result in diseases for all biological systems. In this 
      context, dietary intervention through the use of probiotics, prebiotics and 
      antioxidant foods can be considered a contribution to the modulation of intestinal 
      microbiota. Probiotics have been used to provide up to 10 billion colony forming 
      units, and probiotic foods, Kefir and fermented natural yogurt are also used. 
      Prebiotics, in turn, are found in supplemental formulations of processed foods and 
      in functional foods that are also sources of phenolic compounds, such as flavonoids, 
      antioxidant and anti-inflammatory substances, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, 
      and minerals. In this review, we will discuss the relationship between an imbalance 
      in the intestinal microbiota with the development of diseases, besides indicating 
      the need for future studies that can establish bacterial parameters for the 
      gastrointestinal tract by modulating the intestinal microbiota, associated with the 
      adoption of healthy habits during all life cycles.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With regard to the increasing consumption rates of unhealthy beverages 
      among adolescents, the main purpose of the present study was to determine the 
      association between beverage intake pattern and dental caries and tooth erosion in 
      this age group. METHODS: A total sample of 600 adolescents was recruited in this 
      study using a multistage cluster random sampling method in the city of Kerman, in 
      the southeast of Iran, in 2017. Then, the Decayed, Missed and Filled Teeth (DMFT) 
      index and the Tooth Wear Index (TWI) were registered for each participant. A 
      Beverage Frequency Questionnaire was also employed to estimate typical beverage 
      intake frequency. Correspondingly, negative binominal regression and logistic 
      regression were performed to determine the independent variables associated with the 
      DMFT index and the TWI. RESULTS: The findings revealed that the highest consumed 
      beverage in daily living was tea in both genders, followed by sweetened soft 
      beverages, as well as milk and kefir/yogurt drink. The results of the DMFT index 
      were also significantly different in participants that had never consumed milk 
      compared with those who had used milk on a daily basis. Moreover, the DMFT index in 
      participants who had never consumed sweetened soft beverages was 39%, less than 
      those who had had a daily intake of such beverages. Also, the chance of tooth 
      erosion for participants who had never used sweetened soft beverages was 94%, lower 
      than that in daily consumers. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study revealed that 
      adolescents had an unhealthy beverage intake pattern. Furthermore, milk consumption 
      was beneficial to dental caries, whereas use of soft drinks associated with more 
      dental caries and tooth erosion.

AB  - Ciprofloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic associated with gastric and intestinal 
      side effects after extended oral administration. Alginate is a biopolymer commonly 
      employed in gel synthesis by ionotropic gelation, but unstable in the presence of 
      biological metal-chelating compounds and/or under dried conditions. Kefiran is a 
      microbial biopolymer able to form gels with the advantage of displaying 
      antimicrobial activity. In the present study, kefiran-alginate gel microspheres were 
      developed to encapsulate ciprofloxacin for antimicrobial controlled release and 
      enhanced bactericidal effect against common pathogens. Scanning electron microscopy 
      (SEM) analysis of the hybrid gel microspheres showed a spherical structure with a 
      smoother surface compared to alginate gel matrices. In vitro release of 
      ciprofloxacin from kefiran-alginate microspheres was less than 3.0% and 5.0% at pH 
      1.2 (stomach), and 5.0% and 25.0% at pH 7.4 (intestine) in 3 and 21h, respectively. 
      Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) of ciprofloxacin-kefiran showed the 
      displacement of typical bands of ciprofloxacin and kefiran, suggesting a cooperative 
      interaction by hydrogen bridges between both molecules. Additionally, the thermal 
      analysis of ciprofloxacin-kefiran showed a protective effect of the biopolymer 
      against ciprofloxacin degradation at high temperatures. Finally, antimicrobial 
      assays of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 
      Salmonella typhymurium, and Staphylococcus aureus demonstrated the synergic effect 
      between ciprofloxacin and kefiran against the tested microorganisms.

AB  - The evaluation of the impact of probiotics on host health could help to understand 
      how they can be used in the prevention of diseases. On the basis of our previous 
      studies and in vitro assays on PBMC and Caco-2 ccl20:luc reporter system presented 
      in this work, the strain Lactobacillus kefiri CIDCA 8348 was selected and 
      administrated to healthy Swiss mice daily for 21 days. The probiotic treatment 
      increased IgA in feces and reduced expression of proinflammatory mediators in Peyer 
      Patches and mesenteric lymph nodes, where it also increased IL-10. In ileum IL-10, 
      CXCL-1 and mucin 6 genes were upregulated; meanwhile in colon mucin 4 was induced 
      whereas IFN-γ, GM-CSF, and IL-1β genes were downregulated. Moreover, ileum and colon 
      explants showed the anti-inflammatory effect of L. kefiri since the LPS-induced 
      increment of IL-6 and GM-CSF levels in control mice was significantly attenuated in 
      L. kefiri treated mice. Regarding fecal microbiota, DGGE profiles allowed 
      differentiation of experimental groups in two separated clusters. Quantitative PCR 
      analysis of different bacterial groups revealed only significant changes in 
      Lactobacillus population. In conclusion, L. kefiri is a good candidate to be used in 
      gut inflammatory disorders.

AB  - Lactobacilli kefiranofaciens M1 has shown novel immunomodulation and anti-allergy 
      probiotic attributes in cell and animal models. An acute oral toxicity assessment of 
      L. kefiranofaciens M1 was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were randomly 
      assigned to four groups (12 rats/sex/group): the low dose group was orally gavaged 
      with L. kefiranofaciens M1 at 3.0×10(8)cfu/kg bw while the medium dose and high dose 
      groups received 9.0×10(9)cfu/kg bw and 1.8×10(10)cfu/kg bw, respectively, for 
      28days. The control group received phosphate buffer saline. The body weights were 
      measured weekly while blood samples were collected for haematology and serum 
      biochemistry tests. Histopathology of the organs (heart, liver, kidney, adrenal 
      glands, spleen, ovary, testis), and urinalysis were conducted on study termination. 
      The body weight gain of the L. kefiranofaciens M1 and control groups were comparable 
      during the administration period. Overall, L. kefiranofaciens M1 did not induce 
      adverse effects on haematology, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis parameters. Gross 
      and microscopic histopathology of the organs revealed no toxicity effect of L. 
      kefiranofaciens M1. In conclusion, 1.8×10(10)cfu/kg bw of L. kefiranofaciens M1 was 
      considered as the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL), which was the highest 
      dose tested in the present study.

      Culture (S.C.) 6370], Arthobacter simplex (A.T.C.C. 6949), Mycobacterium vaccae 
      (A.T.C.C. 29678), Candida boidinii (A.T.C.C. 13821) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      (A.T.C.C. 13792) reduced compound 1 to the corresponding (R)-(+)-alcohol (2). In 
      contrast, Lactobacillus kefir (A.T.C.C. 35411), Pullularia pullulans (A.T.C.C. 
      16623), Trigonopsis variabilis (A.T.C.C. 10679) and Cunninghamella echinulata 
      (A.T.C.C. 26269) reduced compound 1 to the (S)-(-)-alcohol (2). When 
      1-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(1-piperazinyl)butan-1-one (3) was used as substrate for the 
      reduction, only Nocardia globerula (A.T.C.C. 12505) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      (A.T.C.C. 13792) converted compound 3 into the corresponding (R)-(+)-alcohol (4). 
      Organisms which reduced compound 1 were inactive for the reduction of compound 3. 
      1-(4-Fluorophenyl)-4-[4-(5-fluoro-2- pyrimidinyl)butan-1-one (5) was reduced to the 
      corresponding (R)-(+)-alcohol (6) by Mortierella ramanniana (A.T.C.C. 38191) and to 
      the (S)-(-)-alcohol (6) by Pullularia pullulans (A.T.C.C. 16623). (R)-(+)-compound 2 
      and compound 4 are key chiral intermediates in the total chemical synthesis of 
      (R)-(+)-compound 6, an effective antipsychotic agent under development at 
      Bristol-Myers Squibb. A single-stage (fermentation/biotransformation) process and 
      two-stage (fermentation and subsequent biotransformation by cell suspensions) 
      process were developed for the stereoselective reduction of compound 5 to 
      (R)-(+)-compound 6 by Mortierella ramanniana (A.T.C.C. 38191). In both processes, 
      the reaction yield of 98% and the optical purity of 99.4% were obtained for 
      (R)-(+)-compound 6. The enzyme which catalysed the reduction of compound 5 to 
      (R)-(+)-compound 6 was purified to homogeneity. The purified protein consisted of a 
      single polypeptide of 29 kDa.

AB  - Probiotic foods, including fermented dairy (FD) products such as yogurt and cheese, 
      naturally contain live microorganisms, but the relationship between the consumption 
      of probiotic foods and health is unclear. The aim of the present narrative review is 
      to integrate the available information on the relationship between the most studied 
      FD products, which are yogurt and cheese, and cardiometabolic risk factors obtained 
      from meta-analysis, systematic reviews of prospective cohort studies (PCSs) and PCSs 
      published up to 2 November 2019. Additionally, the effects identified by randomized 
      controlled trials of less-studied FD products, such as kefir and kimchi, on 
      cardiometabolic risk factors are provided. PCSs have shown that the consumption of 
      cheese, despite its high saturated fat content, is not associated with expected 
      hypercholesterolemia and an increased cardiovascular risk. PCSs have revealed that 
      the total consumption of FD appears to be associated with a lower risk of developing 
      stroke and cardiovascular disease. The consumption of yogurt seems to be associated 
      with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. There is a lack of sufficient 
      evidence of a protective relationship between FD or cheese consumption and metabolic 
      syndrome. Moreover, the association of FD, cheese and yogurt with hypertension needs 
      further evidence. In conclusion, the intake of fermented foods containing 
      probiotics, particularly yogurt and cheese (of an undetermined type), opens up new 
      opportunities for the management of cardiometabolic risk factors.

TI  - [The epidemiology of helicobacteriosis in humans; studies of the survival capacity 
      of the microbe in food].
PG  - 438-43
AB  - In man suffering from diseases of the stomach and the duodenum (gastritis, ulcus, 
      enteritis, neoplasms), Helicobacter pylori (H..pylori) is frequently detected in the 
      mucous membrane of the stomach. Up to now the spread of this agent is not quite 
      clear. Since the direct transmission in humans can be taken for granted, the 
      following study was to find out whether and for how long the agent mentioned above 
      is able to survive in selected food and whether an infection of the consumer by 
      these contaminated food is possible. 376 samples of secretions from the udder of 
      healthy cows and those with mastitis where tested for the presence of H. pylori 
      along with 100 stomachs of chicken from different flocks. In no case H. pylori could 
      be detected. H. pylori was inoculated in high concentrations into milk and some 
      milk-products. From cooled milk samples the agent could still be reisolated after 
      six days in a density up to 10(3) CFU/ml of milk. At room-temperature or 37 degrees 
      C resp. the pathogen could be detected in milk for three to four days only. In 
      yoghurt the agent kept viable for three hours only, whereas in kefir for 24 hours. 
      Mean survival time of then hours was found in pH-neutral curd cheese. The incubation 
      of H.pylori in sterile drip from chicken and in physiologic saline resulted in 
      maximal survival time of at least 48 hours at room temperature. But in 
      H.pylori-broth the number of microorganisms had dropped below the limit of 
      detectability only after 72 hours. At refrigerator-temperature (7 degrees C) H. 
      pylori could still be detected within these three media after 72 hours in high 
      concentrations. In drip from chicken kept at-20 degrees C before thawing H. pylori 
      showed a considerable survival time. After four weeks its number had only dropped by 
      one to two log cycles, whereas in saline and in broth the agent could not be 
      detected anymore after one week at the most. Experiments concerning tenacity showed: 
      On culture-media with different pH-values the growth-optimum of H. pylori was 
      between pH 6.1 and 7.3 H. pylori was suspended in melting water from chicken and 
      brought in thin layers onto wooden board, plastic and ceramic tiles. The bacterium 
      could be recultured from these surfaces only as long as these were moist. At 
      room-temperature the bacterium could not be detected anymore on wood after 30 
      minutes, on plastic or ceramic tiles after 90 minutes. At refrigerator-temperature 
      the administered suspensions dried more slowly, so that H. pylori survived longer, 
      but it still could not be isolated anymore on wood after 240 minutes, on plastic or 
      ceramic tiles after 300 minutes. The decimal reduction-time for H. pylori 
      suspensions in broth were. 72 sec. at +50 degrees C 43 sec. at +52 degrees C 20 sec. 
      at +55 degrees C 10 sec. at +57 degrees C 4 sec. at +60 degrees C from which data z 
      = 7.9 +/- 0.01 degrees C can be calculated. From these experiments on can conclude, 
      that in all probability fresh milk and chicken do not contain H. pylori and thus do 
      not represent a source of infection for man. After contamination of slaughtered 
      chicken within the abattoir or from milk and milk-products within dairy industry by 
      insufficient hygiene-management of infected personnel it can not be excluded, that 
      H. pylori gets into households by these foods. An infection of the consumer by this 
      route is not very likely, but can not be excluded with complete certainly.

TI  - Effects of Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris YRC3780 daily intake on the HPA axis 
      response to acute psychological stress in healthy Japanese men.
LID - 10.1038/s41430-021-00978-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris (YRC3780), which is isolated from 
      kefir, has been associated with anti-allergic effects in humans. However, it remains 
      unknown whether daily intake of YRC3780 attenuates the response to psychological 
      stress in humans in parallel with changes to the gut microbiome. We examined the 
      fundamental role of YRC3780 in the gut microbiome, stress response, sleep, and 
      mental health in humans. METHODS: Effects of daily intake of YRC3780 on the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to acute psychological stress 
      were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 27 
      healthy young men (mean age and body mass index: 23.5 years and 21.5 kg/m(2)) who 
      were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 13) or YRC3780 (n = 14) groups. The HPA axis 
      response to acute psychological stress, the diurnal rhythm of HPA axis activity, and 
      gut microbiome were assessed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The 
      results showed that daily intake of YRC3780 significantly lowered morning salivary 
      cortisol levels compared with placebo. In addition, salivary cortisol levels 
      following a social stress test significantly decreased +40 min after beginning the 
      TSST in the YRC3780-treated group compared to placebo. There were no significant 
      differences between the two groups in terms of actigraphy-based sleep quality, but 
      the subjective sleep quality and mental health were significantly improved in the 
      YRC3780-treated group compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that 
      daily intake of YRC3780 improves the HPA axis response to acute psychological 
      stress, which might be associated with a decrease in morning cortisol levels.

TI  - Effects of the oral administration of the exopolysaccharide produced by 
      Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens on the gut mucosal immunity.
PG  - 254-60
AB  - The probiotic effects ascribed to lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and their fermented 
      dairy products arise not only from whole microorganisms and cell wall components but 
      also from peptides and extracellular polysaccharides (exopolysaccharides) produced 
      during the fermentation of milk. There is a lack of knowledge concerning the immune 
      mechanisms induced by exopolysaccharides produced by lactic acid bacteria, which 
      would allow a better understanding of the functional effects described to them. The 
      aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo immunomodulating capacity of the 
      exopolysaccharide produced by Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens by analyzing the profile 
      of cytokines and immunoglobulins induced at the intestinal mucosa level, in the 
      intestinal fluid and blood serum. BALB/c mice received the exopolysaccharide 
      produced by L. kefiranofaciens for 2, 5 or 7 consecutive days. At the end of each 
      period of administration, control and treated mice were sacrificed and the numbers 
      of IgA+ and IgG+ cells were determined on histological slices of the small and large 
      intestine by immunofluorescence. Cytokines (IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IFNgamma and 
      TNFalpha) were also determined in the gut lamina propria as well as in the 
      intestinal fluid and blood serum. There was an increase of IgA+ cells in the small 
      and large intestine lamina propria, without change in the number of IgG+ cells in 
      the small intestine. This study reports the effects of the oral administration of 
      the exopolysaccharide produced by L. kefiranofaciens in the number of IgA+ cells in 
      the small and large intestine, comparing simultaneously the production of cytokines 
      by cells of the lamina propria and in the intestinal fluid and blood serum. The 
      increase in the number of IgA+ cells was not simultaneously accompanied by an 
      enhance of the number of IL-4+ cells in the small intestine. This finding would be 
      in accordance with the fact that, in general, polysaccharide antigens elicit a 
      T-independent immune response. For IL-10+, IL-6+ and IL-12+ cells, the values found 
      were slightly increased compared to control values, while IFNgamma+ and TNFalpha+ 
      cells did not change compared to control values. The effects observed on 
      immunoglobulins and in all the cytokines assayed in the large intestine after 
      kefiran administration were of greater magnitude than the ones observed in the small 
      intestine lamina propria, which may be due to the saccharolytic action of the 
      colonic microflora. In the intestinal fluid, only IL-4 and IL-12 increased compared 
      to control values. In blood serum, all the cytokines assayed followed a pattern of 
      production quite similar to the one found for them in the small intestine lamina 
      propria. We observed that the exopolysaccharide induced a gut mucosal response and 
      it was able to up and down regulate it for protective immunity, maintaining 
      intestinal homeostasis, enhancing the IgA production at both the small and large 
      intestine level and influencing the systemic immunity through the cytokines released 
      to the circulating blood.

TI  - Microbiological and Chemical Properties of Chokeberry Juice Fermented by Novel 
      Lactic Acid Bacteria with Potential Probiotic Properties during Fermentation at 4 °C 
      for 4 Weeks.
LID - 10.3390/foods10040768 [doi]
LID - 768
AB  - On the frame of this research survey, a novel potentially probiotic strain 
      (Lactobacillus paracasei SP5) recently isolated from kefir grains was evaluated for 
      chokeberry juice fermentation. Chokeberry juice was retrieved from the variety 
      Aronia melanocarpa, a plant known to provide small, dark berries and to be one of 
      the richest sources of antioxidants. The juice was subsequently fermented 
      inoculating L. paracasei SP5 for 48 h at 30 °C. The fermented juices were left at 4 
      °C and tested regarding microbiological and physicochemical characteristics for 4 
      weeks. The potentially probiotic strain was proved capable of performing lactic acid 
      fermentation at 30 °C. Cell viability of L. paracasei was detected in high levels 
      during fermentation and the whole storage period, while the fermented juice showed 
      higher levels of viability in juice with 40.3 g/L of initial sugar concentration. No 
      ethanol was detected in the final fermented juice. Fermented chokeberry juice was 
      characterized by aromatic desirable volatiles, which were retained in adequate 
      levels for the whole storage period. Specifically, the occurrence of organic esters 
      detected in fermented juices is considered as positive evidence of the provision of 
      fruity and floral notes to the final product. During storage, total phenolics 
      content and antioxidant activity were observed in higher levels in fermented 
      chokeberry juice compared with non-fermented juice. Subsequently, fermentation of 
      chokeberry juice by potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria could provide high 
      industrialization potential, providing the market with a nutritional beverage of 
      good volatile quality with an enhanced shelf-life compared with an unfermented fresh 
      juice.

TI  - Carbonyl reductase identification and development of whole-cell biotransformation 
      for highly efficient synthesis of (R)-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] ethanol.
PG  - 191
LID - 191
AB  - BACKGROUND: (R)-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] ethanol [(R)-3,5-BTPE] is a 
      valuable chiral intermediate for Aprepitant (Emend) and Fosaprepitant (Ivemend). 
      Biocatalyzed asymmetric reduction is a preferred approach to synthesize highly 
      optically active (R)-3,5-BTPE. However, the product concentration and productivity 
      of reported (R)-3,5-BTPE synthetic processes remain unsatisfied. RESULTS: A 
      NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase from Lactobacillus kefir (LkCR) was discovered by 
      genome mining for reduction of 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl) acetophenone (3,5-BTAP) into 
      (R)-3,5-BTPE with excellent enantioselectivity. In order to synthesize (R)-3,5-BTPE 
      efficiently, LkCR was coexpressed with glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis 
      (BsGDH) for NADPH regeneration in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells, and the optimal 
      recombinant strain produced 250.3 g/L (R)-3,5-BTPE with 99.9% ee but an unsatisfied 
      productivity of 5.21 g/(L h). Then, four different linker peptides were used for the 
      fusion expression of LkCR and BsGDH in E. coli to regulate catalytic efficiency of 
      the enzymes and improved NADPH-recycling efficiency. Using the best strain (E. 
      coli/pET-BsGDH-ER/K(10 nm)-LkCR), up to 297.3 g/L (R)-3,5-BTPE with 
      enantiopurity >99.9% ee was produced via reduction of as much as 1.2 M of substrate 
      with a 96.7% yield and productivity of 29.7 g/(L h). CONCLUSIONS: Recombinant E. 
      coli/pET-BsGDH-ER/K(10 nm)-LkCR was developed for the bioreduction of 3,5-BTAP to 
      (R)-3,5-BTPE, offered the best results in terms of high product concentration and 
      productivity, demonstrating its great potential in industrial manufacturing of 
      (R)-3,5-BTPE.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the two main forms of inflammatory bowel 
      disease (IBD), are immunologically mediated disorders. Several therapies are focused 
      on activated T cells as key targets. Although Lactobacillus kefiri has shown 
      anti-inflammatory effects in animal models, few studies were done using human 
      mucosal T cells. The aim of this work was to investigate the immunomodulatory 
      effects of this bacterium on intestinal T cells from patients with active IBD. 
      Mucosal biopsies and surgical samples from IBD adult patients (n = 19) or healthy 
      donors (HC; n = 5) were used. Lamina propria mononuclear cells were isolated by 
      enzymatic tissue digestion, and entero-adhesive Escherichia coli-specific lamina 
      propria T cells (LPTC) were expanded. The immunomodulatory properties of L. kefiri 
      CIDCA 8348 strain were evaluated on biopsies and on anti-CD3/CD28-activated LPTC. 
      Secreted cytokines were quantified by ELISA, and cell proliferation and viability 
      were assessed by flow cytometry. We found that L. kefiri reduced spontaneous release 
      of IL-6 and IL-8 from inflamed biopsies ex vivo. Activated LPTC from IBD patients 
      showed low proliferative rates and reduced secretion of TNF-α, IL-6, IFN-γ and IL-13 
      in the presence of L. kefiri. In addition, L. kefiri induced an increased frequency 
      of CD4(+)FOXP3(+) LPTC along with high levels of IL-10. This is the first report 
      showing an immunomodulatory effect of L. kefiri CIDCA 8348 on human intestinal cells 
      from IBD patients. Understanding the mechanisms of interaction between probiotics 
      and immune mucosal cells may open new avenues for treatment and prevention of IBD.

AB  - Acetobacter pasteurianus is an acetic acid-producing Gram-negative bacterium 
      commonly found associated with plants and plant products and widely used in the 
      production of fermented foods, such as kefir and vinegar. Due to the acid conditions 
      of the bacterium living habitat, uncommon structural features composing its cell 
      envelope are expected. In the present work we have investigated the A. pasteurianus 
      CIP103108 lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure and immunoactivity. The structure of 
      the lipid A and of two different O-polysaccharides was assessed. Furthermore, 
      immunological studies with human cells showed a low immunostimulant activity of the 
      isolated LPS, in addition to a slight capability to lower the NF-kB activation upon 
      stimulation by toxic LPS.

AB  - For the integral assessment of diet, tools have been proposed, called nutritional 
      quality indices, and, as separate options, healthy eating indices (HEI), which 
      assess diets in relation to compliance with existing national recommendations for 
      healthy eating for the population. The aim of this work was to investigate the 
      suitability and reliability of the developed baseline HEI for assessing the nature 
      of the diet, modifications of the diet and eating behavior of the population. 
      Methods. To analyze the suitability and reliability of the HEI for assessing the 
      features of dietary intake and eating behavior of the population, the data on the 
      actual nutrition and eating behavior of adults 19+ years of both sexes obtained by 
      Rosstat in 2013 and 2018 have been used. Along with using the 24-hour food replay 
      method to study actual food intake, the questionnaires included a form for assessing 
      the frequency of consumption of major food groups in a standard format: daily or 
      several times a week, once a week, several times a month, once a month or less 
      often, practically do not consume. Results. The average HEI values for women in all 
      food consumption groups are significantly higher than for men (p<0.01). Changes in 
      average HEI values depending on the level of consumption of various products are 
      multidirectional. When foods such as grains, vegetables and fruits are consumed in 
      quantities greater than the median, the HEI is significantly higher than when 
      consumed at less than the median level. On the contrary, when consuming more than 
      the median of meat products, fatty products and confectionery products, as well as 
      for those who consumed sausages, the HEI for both women and men is significantly 
      lower than for those who consumed less than the median or did not consume these 
      products. The average HEI values in men and women who consumed cottage cheese, kefir 
      or yogurt are significantly higher than among those who did not consume these foods. 
      Significantly higher HEI values were found in vegetarians compared to 
      non-vegetarians. The average HEI values of adults of both sexes in autumn are 
      significantly higher than in spring, which is confirmed by the significantly higher 
      consumption of vegetables and fruits in autumn, w hich are components- indicators of 
      the integral HEI. The dependence of the HEI values on the frequency of consumption 
      of the main food groups, which are its components or affect the consumption of 
      components, has been shown. The higher the frequency of consumpt ion of meat 
      products, butter, salad dressings, chocolate and sweets or sweet carbonated drinks 
      the lower is the HEI. On the other hand, the higher the frequency of consumption of 
      vegetables, fruits, milk, fermented milk, cottage cheese or curd the higher is the 
      HEI. Conclusion. The changes in the values of the HEI at various values, as well as 
      the frequency, of food consumption indicate the possibility of HEI using as a marker 
      for assessing the relationship between diet, health status and the incidence of 
      chronic noncommunicable diseases.

AB  - Mutants of Lactobacillus kefir short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase, used here as 
      ketoreductases (KREDs), enantioselectively reduce the pharmaceutically relevant 
      substrates 3-thiacyclopentanone and 3-oxacyclopentanone. These substrates differ by 
      only the heteroatom (S or O) in the ring, but the KRED mutants reduce them with 
      different enantioselectivities. Kinetic studies show that these enzymes are more 
      efficient with 3-thiacyclopentanone than with 3-oxacyclopentanone. X-ray crystal 
      structures of apo- and NADP(+)-bound selected mutants show that the 
      substrate-binding loop conformational preferences are modified by these mutations. 
      Quantum mechanical calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are used to 
      investigate the mechanism of reduction by the enzyme. We have developed an MD-based 
      method for studying the diastereomeric transition state complexes and rationalize 
      different enantiomeric ratios. This method, which probes the stability of the 
      catalytic arrangement within the theozyme, shows a correlation between the relative 
      fractions of catalytically competent poses for the enantiomeric reductions and the 
      experimental enantiomeric ratio. Some mutations, such as A94F and Y190F, induce 
      conformational changes in the active site that enlarge the small binding pocket, 
      facilitating accommodation of the larger S atom in this region and enhancing 
      S-selectivity with 3-thiacyclopentanone. In contrast, in the E145S mutant and the 
      final variant evolved for large-scale production of the intermediate for the 
      antibiotic sulopenem, R-selectivity is promoted by shrinking the small binding 
      pocket, thereby destabilizing the pro-S orientation.

TI  - Interventions for the management of abdominal pain in Crohn's disease and 
      inflammatory bowel disease.
PG  - CD013531
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD013531.pub2 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crohn's disease is a remitting and relapsing disorder that can affect 
      the whole gastrointestinal tract. Active disease symptoms include abdominal pain, 
      fatigue, weight loss, and diarrhoea. There is no known cure; however, the disease 
      can be managed, and therefore places a huge financial burden on healthcare systems. 
      Abdominal pain is a common and debilitating symptom of Crohn's and other 
      inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), and is multifaceted. Abdominal pain in Crohn's 
      disease could be a symptom of disease relapse or related to medication adverse 
      effects, surgical complications and strictures or adhesions secondary to IBD. In the 
      absence of these factors, around 20 to 50% of people with Crohn's in remission still 
      experience pain. OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy and safety of interventions for 
      managing abdominal pain in people with Crohn's disease and IBD (where data on 
      ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease could not be separated). SEARCH METHODS: We 
      searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, three other databases, and clinical trials registries on 
      29 April 2021. We also searched the references of trials and systematic reviews for 
      any additional trials. SELECTION CRITERIA: All published, unpublished, and ongoing 
      randomised trials that compared interventions for the management of abdominal pain 
      in the setting of Crohn's disease and IBD, with other active interventions or 
      standard therapy, placebo, or no therapy were included. We excluded studies that did 
      not report on any abdominal pain outcomes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Five review 
      authors independently conducted data extraction and 'Risk of bias' assessment of the 
      included studies. We analysed data using Review Manager 5. We expressed dichotomous 
      and continuous outcomes as risk ratios and mean differences with 95% confidence 
      intervals. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE methodology. MAIN 
      RESULTS: We included 14 studies (743 randomised participants). Five studies 
      evaluated participants with Crohn's disease; seven studies evaluated participants 
      with IBD where the data on ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease could not be 
      separated; and two studies provided separate results for Crohn's disease 
      participants. Studies considered a range of disease activity states. Two studies 
      provided intervention success definitions, whilst the remaining studies measured 
      pain as a continuous outcome on a rating scale. All studies except one measured pain 
      intensity, whilst three studies measured pain frequency. Withdrawals due to adverse 
      events were directly or indirectly reported in 10 studies. No conclusions could be 
      drawn about the efficacy of the majority of the interventions on pain intensity, 
      pain frequency, and treatment success, except for the comparison of transcranial 
      direct current stimulation to sham stimulation. The certainty of the evidence was 
      very low in all but one comparison because of imprecision due to sparse data and 
      risk of bias assessed as unclear or high risk. Two studies compared a low FODMAP 
      diet (n=37) to a sham diet (n=45) in IBD patients. The evidence on pain intensity 
      was of very low certainty (MD -12.00, 95% CI -114.55 to 90.55). One study reported 
      pain intensity separately for CD participants in the low FODMAP group [n=14, 
      mean(SD)=24 (82.3)] and the sham group [n=12, mean(SD)=32 (69.3)]. The same study 
      also reported pain frequency for IBD participants in the low FODMAP group [n=27, 
      mean(SD)=36 (26)] and sham group [n=25, mean(SD)=38(25)] and CD participants in the 
      low FODMAP group [n=14, mean(SD)=36 (138.4)] and sham group [n=12, mean(SD)=48 
      (128.2)]. Treatment success was not reported. One study compared a low FODMAP diet 
      (n=25) to high FODMAP/normal diet (n=25) in IBD patients. The data reported on pain 
      intensity was unclear. Treatment success and pain frequency were not reported. One 
      study compared medicine-separated moxibustion combined with acupuncture (n=51) 
      versus wheat bran-separated moxibustion combined with shallow acupuncture (n=51) in 
      CD patients. The data reported on pain intensity and frequency were unclear. 
      Treatment success was not reported. One study compared mindfulness with CBT (n=33) 
      versus no treatment (n=33) in IBD patients. The evidence is very uncertain about the 
      effect of this treatment on pain intensity and frequency (MD -37.00, 95% CI -87.29 
      to 13.29). Treatment success was not reported. One study compared soft 
      non-manipulative osteopathic treatment (n=16) with no treatment besides doctor 
      advice (n=14) in CD patients. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of 
      this treatment on pain intensity (MD 0.01, 95% CI -1.81 to 1.83). Treatment success 
      and pain frequency were not reported. One study compared stress management (n=15) to 
      self-directed stress management(n=15) and to standard treatment (n=15) in CD 
      patients. The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of these treatments on 
      pain intensity (MD -30.50, 95% CI -58.45 to -2.55 and MD -34.30, 95% CI -61.99 to 
      -6.61). Treatment success and pain frequency were not reported. One study compared 
      enteric-release glyceryl trinitrate (n=34) with placebo (n=36) in CD patients. The 
      data reported on pain intensity was unclear. Treatment success and pain frequency 
      were not reported.  One study compared 100 mg olorinab three times per day (n=8) 
      with 25 mg olorinab three times per day (n=6) in CD patients. Pain intensity was 
      measured as a 30% reduction in weekly average abdominal pain intensity score for the 
      100mg group (n=5) and the 25mg group (n=6). The evidence is very uncertain about the 
      effect of this treatment on pain intensity (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.15). Treatment 
      success and pain frequency were not reported. One study compared relaxation training 
      (n=28) to a waitlist (n=28) in IBD patients. The evidence is very uncertain about 
      the effect of this treatment on pain intensity (MD -0.72, 95% CI -1.85 to 0.41). 
      Treatment success and pain frequency were not reported. One study compared web-based 
      education (n=30) with a book-based education (n=30) in IBD patients. The evidence is 
      very uncertain about the effect of this treatment on pain intensity (MD -0.13, 95% 
      CI -1.25 to 0.99). Treatment success and pain frequency were not reported. One study 
      compared yoga (n=50) with no treatment (n=50) in IBD patients. The data reported on 
      treatment success were unclear. Pain frequency and intensity were not reported. One 
      study compared transcranial direct current stimulation (n = 10) to sham stimulation 
      (n = 10) in IBD patients. There may be an improvement in pain intensity when 
      transcranial direct current is compared to sham stimulation (MD -1.65, 95% CI -3.29 
      to -0.01, low-certainty evidence). Treatment success and pain frequency were not 
      reported. One study compared a kefir diet (Lactobacillus bacteria) to no 
      intervention in IBD patients and provided separate data for their CD participants. 
      The evidence is very uncertain about the effect of this treatment on pain 
      intensity in IBD (MD 0.62, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.07) and CD (MD -1.10, 95% CI -1.67 to 
      -0.53). Treatment success and pain frequency were not reported. Reporting of our 
      secondary outcomes was inconsistent. The most adverse events were reported in the 
      enteric-release glyceryl trinitrate and olorinab studies.  In the enteric-release 
      glyceryl trinitrate study, the adverse events were higher in the intervention arm. 
      In the olorinab study, more adverse events were observed in the higher dose arm of 
      the intervention.  In the studies on non-drug interventions, adverse events tended 
      to be very low or zero. However, no clear judgements regarding adverse events can be 
      drawn for any interventions due to the low number of events. Anxiety and depression 
      were measured and reported at the end of intervention in only one study; therefore, 
      no meaningful conclusions can be drawn for this outcome. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We 
      found low certainty evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation may 
      improve pain intensity compared to sham stimulation. We could not reach any 
      conclusions on the efficacy of any other interventions on pain intensity, pain 
      frequency, and treatment success. The certainty of the evidence was very low due to 
      the low numbers of studies and participants in each comparison and clinical 
      heterogeneity amongst the studies. While no serious or total adverse events were 
      elicited explicitly with any of the treatments studied, the reported events were 
      very low. The certainty of the evidence for all comparisons was very low, so no 
      conclusions can be drawn.
